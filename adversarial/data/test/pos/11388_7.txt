J and I were in the mood for Chinese Saturday night.  We decide to get takeout from Autumn Court.  \n\nJ calls in the order.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken (a chef specialty apparently) and J ordered the Pepper Steak.  J also gets an order of pot stickers and we get a couple egg rolls. He's told that it will be ready in 10 minutes.  Talk about fast.  Maybe too fast?  \n\nI get there and the restaurant is completely empty.  For 7:30 on a Saturday night, that raises a reddish flag for me.  I get our food, pay - it comes to $31, and head on home.  When I get home we strip off the 2 ft of saran wrap off our dinner boxes and dig in.  My lemon chicken was super soggy.  Like it had been cooked and them steamed (maybe because it wasn't vented in the take out container?)  J's pepper steak was chewy and the sauteed vegetables (peppers and onions) were mushy.  As if they had been (to quote J) stewed.  \n\nWe could have gotten better quality Chinese at Panda.  At least we would have known it was freshly made.
