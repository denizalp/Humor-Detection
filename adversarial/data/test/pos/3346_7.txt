I live three blocks from here, and just finally got Crisped a couple of weeks back. Something weird was keeping me away, like I needed to get highlights first, or was it a fear that mediocrity from the next door Crapbucks was going to creep in and make my salad meh? Who knows. \/end snark\n\nSo yes, you can eat here, well, my vegan loves. Duh, I know, salad place, but ya - the tofu is a little freaky, fried then grilled, char lines so black you'd swear they were Sharpie, but at least its here. Super fresh greens and sharply flavored dressings, of which there are several cheese-free options. Staff is on top of table clearing and salad tossing (heh) so the pace here is less comfy, more salad factory. Gets crowded. 9 dolla salad. Kinda pricey, but I left full and satisfied.\n\nI think I even saw a vegan soup on ze blackboard - wootwoot.
