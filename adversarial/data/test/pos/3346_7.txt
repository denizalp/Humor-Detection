Sent here by our gardener, we waited quite a while to get someone to show us plants.  The owner and two other employees in the office would not make eye contact and did not speak to us.... But they talked constantly in Spanish among themselves. The plants did not look that healthy.  It says it is a wholesale and retail nursery, but I don't think they normally deal with the public.  Left with nothing and went to Moon Valley
