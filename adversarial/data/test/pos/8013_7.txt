This is some bad ass Italian food. I had in th3 Happy Hour appetizers: 1. Stuffed peppers 2. Octopus 3. Caesar. All 3 very good\nMain course: Branzino  (super)\nDessert: Tiramisu (u can't go wrong)\nDo it! Michael W is a great server will advise u right from ur drink to dessert. The live music adds to the ambience. I am glad I came here
