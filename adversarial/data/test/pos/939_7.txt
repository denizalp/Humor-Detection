hot, wet and spicy\ngo there and kiss your sandwich\nwith tongue. and mustard.\n\nNot too many places for a tongue sandwich here in Cleveland, and before you \"eeeewww\" just imagine what the next level of corned beef would be. \nLet me tell you:  get a tongue sandwich from here and you will never look back. \nThis is a no frills place where you can get Davis Bakeries fresh rye bread by the loaf, or half loaf, a huge assortment of meats and various pickles. \n\nThe sandwiches are on par with Mister Brisket but with better bread. Slyman's is a distant second. \n\nCarry on.
