Been waiting 2 years\n\n     Saw his sign go up 2 years ago and it took this long to get back...   after reading the reviews, I decided to get two rolls to go, the previous evening.  They were good, so tonight we went for dinner.  \n     Got the 13 year olds, edamame, miso soup, two California rolls and the sticky ribs.  You would have thought I hadn't fed them in years, based upon how quickly the food disappeared.  Guess they liked it.  \nWe got the crispy fish and bop with pork belly.  The bop was awesome, the crispy fish, not so much, it was over done and felt like it was missing meat.  Wouldn't recommend frying a 10\" Barramundi.  What a waste of an exceptional fish.  \n     Loved the space and atmosphere.  The pricing is inline with most Las Vegas restaurants as well as the portion size.  Food was worthy of another visit.  BUT, I didn't feel like any of the recipes were OMG this obviously came from the mind of an Iron Chef, the caliber of Morimoto.  It is just a good Japanese restaurant and nothing more.
