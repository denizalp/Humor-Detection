I probably should give \"Whole Paycheck\" one star for being so offensively expensive and getting away with it all these years.  I hate this place.  I go here as little as possible nowadays.  Back in Los Angeles many years ago I used to frequent the Glendale location multiple times a week, and I was a complete moron for doing so.  However, I will give them props for turning me on to sushi, I was never into it until I ate it at stupid Whole Foods.  Now if only I could convert my husband.  :(\n\nRegardless of my utter hate, when I really want to cook something good with the best ingredients, I always end up here when I can't find something at Trader Joe's.  For instance, I have a huge craving for homemade spaghetti and meatballs today.  I know I can't get many of the ingredients there (ground veal and pork for meatballs, San Marzano Tomatoes for sauce), and I don't feel like driving all the way up to Glazier's to see what they have.  So I guess I'm going by here today, dammit to hell.\n\nAlso, I have always had a weakness for their mac and cheese and the fried chicken in their hot section.  It's really delicious, or it used to be.  I haven't had it in awhile.  There was a \"New Yorker\" sandwich that I adored in Glendale that I haven't seen anywhere else that I'd still eat in a heartbeat.  Of course, all overpriced.  \n\nI did tell myself that I would never go here again when the CEO John Mackey was in the news spewing his anti-health care reform rhetoric.  What a tool.  But I guess I'm going to be a hypocritical asshole and go anyhow.  I'm so ashamed.
