Oh. My. Goodness.\nThe food is soooo yummy and people that work there are so nice!\nWhen I first came to CU I was so upset that I couldn't find a Korean restaurant that met my standards but then I discovered this little gem and I couldn't be happier. I have to admit, this isn't my all time favorite Korean restaurant but they are definitely the best in the CU area.\nThey give so many side dishes which is always a huge plus in my book (the potato salad is my favorite!).\nIf you haven't tried this restaurant yet, I definitely recommend it!
