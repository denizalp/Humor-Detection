The owner is a mean lady. She does not know how to treat customers or employees. I have heard numerous complaints about the customer service from her, it is all sad but true. They charge too much for anything in there. The prices are inflated for the visiting yuppies. My friend Justin stated \"$4 for a two scoop cone. You could get two two scoop cones at UDF!\". If I really was in the need for ice cream or a shake, which I rarely am, I will get in my car and drive to Malley's in Lakewood. I have a bone to pick with them, I will address that in my next review.
