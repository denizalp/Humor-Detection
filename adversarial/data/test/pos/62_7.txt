I've seen this show twice in 10 months. It's that good! The first time, we had 3rd row seats and we ended up with neck pain and we kept missing performers dangling from the ceiling a few rows back. The second time we were in row R which was perfect - we saw everything. Jamone! Hee hee! They made a few minor changes since the first time I've seen \"One\".\n\nI've also seen \"Michael Jackson Immortal\" which is a bit similar but not really. Some songs were the same - of course his biggest hits were in both shows. I'm an MJ fan before he became white.\n\n\"I'm gonna make a change for once in my life.\" I might have to edit\/update all my Cirque du Soleil reviews. I've seen Ka, Zumanity, Beatles LOVE, O, Zarkana, etc. and I've ranked them in a previous review. This is now my 2nd favorite CdS show...LOVE is still my fave.\n\n\"The way you make me feel. You really turn me on.\" Lights, music, costume, set, illusion\/ visual effects, choreography, acrobatics and snow  (\"Stranger in Moscow\"). This show has it all. Compared to all CdS shows, this has more dancing\/ choreography than acrobatics. I hate to say it's \"mind-blowing\"...that sounds painful!\n\nHighlights of the show include \"Dirty Diana\"(...girl with abs - HOOOO!!!), \"Human Nature\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Thriller\", \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Black or White\". The MJ hologram was incredible.\n\n\"Beat it beat it beat it! Just beat it!\"...if you don't like MJ or this show. Because Michael, \"I just can't stop loving you.\" You'll be dancing (or at least tapping your foot, snapping your fingers and bobbing your head) and singing while watching the show.  I guess the only thing I'm not too happy about was that \"Ben\" was not included in the show...that's one of my faves but it's a sad song and probably would not fit anywhere in the show.
