I really enjoyed my Omakase experience at Shoushin. I would suggest going for the Ume ($80) if it is your first time here at Shoushin and just want to have a taste of what they offers.\n\nI do love the diversity of their menu: they serves both cook food and sushi. The cooked food is interesting and love the plating. The plates\/bowls they used are all so pretty and unique! Almost all the nigiri sushi are prepared by Chef Jackie which I appreciate but it was kind of stressful\/funny when I saw him running across the sushi counter. \n\nBeer, Sake and wine menu has some interesting items. A little pricey but the sake sampler is a great value!\n\nThe service is top notch here. The staff all so well trained and fully understand the menu. Always polite, discreet and anticipate your need. \n\nShoushin is worth the experience especially you enjoy Japanese food. I don't know if I would have spend $250 on a Kiku meal. But I was quite happy even with the Ume.
