I will preface this 3 star review by saying it is my fault for not reading any reviews of this restaurant and blindly going off of word of mouth alone but this pizza is terrible.  Don't get me wrong, I've went through my early 20s drinking warm beer and eating cold pizza the day after a house party but the difference was that pizza was fully cooked at some point in time.  This pizza is near raw.  The cook bakes the crust, slathers on cold sauce, dumps a handful of cold cheese and toppings onto your pizza and hands it to you.  I can't handle this.  Even as a rare steak eater I need my cheese, banana peppers, and pepperoni to be cooked.  On top of that, where are the red pepper flakes?  \n\nPerhaps this is just not for me but it has such an amazing reputation in PGH (so much there will be lines out the door during Steelers or Pens games) that I can't give it 1 star (that and my own idiocy).  Let me say: I've warned you.
