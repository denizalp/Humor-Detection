Went before dark on a Sunday, so the tickets were only $7.25. The sign out front says tickets are only $5.00 before 6:00pm Monday - Thursday. So admission won't break the bank. You must purchase tickets outside, so weather could be an issue depending upon the time of year you go. We had no issues, as it was a pleasant day with comfortable temps. The staff was friendly and AMC offers free refills on large popcorn AND soda, which some other theaters in town do not. The butter flavoring for the popcorn is self-serve which made it difficult to get it mixed in throughout, as you can't put it on as you fill the popcorn. However, they did have boxes sitting out next to the butter which helped to split up the popcorn and get the butter more evenly disributed.\n\nThis was by no stretch a luxury theater, but the seats were comfortable and did recline slightly. The temperature of the theater was a little on the cold side, which I prefer. It was a little too cold for the Mrs. though. It was a nice change of pace to visit a theater that wasn't attached to a casino. Probably saved me a few bucks too, as there were no slot machines or blackjack tables to drop dinero on.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent movie going experience and we will definitely return. Critics slammed the movie Grudge Match, but we thought it was good. If you are expecting Rocky or Raging Bull, you'll be shocked. It's more along the lines of Grumpy Old Men with a boxing twist.
