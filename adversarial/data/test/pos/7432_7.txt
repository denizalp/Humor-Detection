I only come to casino's on vacations.  And I generally only come with my husband, but I was feeling lady luck leading me to this casino.  I am glad she did.  Not only did I win about $400, I had a great time.\n\nFor those who complain about the excitement level... It's Cleveland.  Not Vegas.  Not Atlantic City.  Not even Reno.  It's a smaller casino in the downtown area of a major metropolitan city.  It's not fancy, but its fun.\n\nWhen I came the staff at at security area were so kind.  I bought a glass of wine at one of the beautiful bars.  Not only was the wine reasonably priced, the staff were so friendly.\n\nMaybe it was my lucky day, but I won a lot at the slot machines. \n\nYou can actually breathe the air in this casino.  It's not smokey and disgusting like other places.\n\nThey have several buffets and a burger restaurant in addition to others.  \n\nIt's a great place to spend a few hours in Cleveland!
