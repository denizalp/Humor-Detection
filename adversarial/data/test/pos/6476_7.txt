This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Phoenix. Half of our order was forgotten all together, what did get delivered was pathetic and borderline inedible. The manager at this restaurant was unwilling to refund my money for the forgotten food, or the four noodles and spoon of sauce they called \"baked ziti.\" The Zeppoli wasn't anywhere near as the reviews make it seem, NYPD Pizza is much better, which is sad, as they're a chain restaurant.\n\nTerrible food.\nTerrible portion size.\nTerrible service.\n\nThis place won't be around long.
