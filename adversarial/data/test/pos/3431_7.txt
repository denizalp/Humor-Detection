I'm hooked. This is my absolute favorite fast fired pizza place. They have won my allegiance. The price is perfect for what you get. I'm very impressed. I love that you can make it any way you want and it's ready in minutes. Great pizza. I ordered mine online so it was mostly ready when I arrived they just had to put it in the oven and I was on my way. It wasn't that busy when I was there, but I've heard it can get crazy. I ordered the roasted garlic and they were giant pieces of delicious garlic... next time I'm going to try for crushed garlic as it was a little too much garlic at a time. :) Service is fast and friendly. They seem very efficient and organized. I can't wait for my next pizza!
