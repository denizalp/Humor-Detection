Alrighty, we get here and only one girl was working a big order. So it took forever just to get our order started.\nFinally a guy named Jorge comes out of the bathroom or whatever, and goes in to take our order. He starts out asking what we want and is just flat out rude the entire time. Didn't even say hello was demanding us to give him our order. I give him my order and I told him exactly what I wanted but he got a phone call on his personal phone and left to go answer the call. So the girl took over, and I had to repeat my order and she gave me crap for telling her spinach last. Um she chose to put it last, I simply called out the items and she could have put it on first if she wanted.\nShe also came from the back where she was stocking up chicken trays into a container. She wasn't gonna switch her gloves when she was gonna do my order until I asked her if she was getting new gloves.\nShe goes yeah I'll change them if you want, I was just doing the chicken.\nLike HELLO. Especially if you're doing chicken so I want your gloves changed. That should be automatic, homegirl.\nThe sodas are flat as well.\n\nOverall super annoyed with Jorge thinking his phone call is more important than doing his job.
