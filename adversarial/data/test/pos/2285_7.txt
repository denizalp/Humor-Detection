Best Fish n Chips in town! Cozy laid back unpretentious atmosphere. Feels like the ones I used to go to back in Boston. Poutine is also great. Prices are reasonable with great lunch specials and a lot of food for the money. So much better than the overpriced pseudo gastro pubs on the strip. This place is also great for kids. Pool table and darts to keep them happy and not a bunch of obnoxious drunk people hanging around.
