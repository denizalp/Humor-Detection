Spacious!  Seats up to 150 guests.\nNice ambiance with appropriate decors.\n3 sinks!  Yes, right in the hallway near the restrooms, so your hands can freshen up before you dig right into your next round cajun yumminess or desserts :)\n\nThat pretty much sums up some of the important observations while I was at the newly opened Cravin' Cajun, the latest Louisiana crawfish boils restaurant to open up in Las Vegas.\n\nCC serves the same kind of menu offered by other restaurants in the same category. The seasoning comes in three (possibly four) options: Kiddie Cajun (Lightly seasoned), Cravin's Cajun (the restaurant's signature blend), Lemon Pepper (A Cravin's favorite), and maybe Ravin' Cajun! (their combination of all of their flavors). Then you can further specify the heat levels: Mild, Medium, Hot, Crazy Cravin' Hot.\n\nI tried the shrimp with the Cravin' Cajun (medium) and it was served up in the familiar plastic bag over white butcher paper covered table.  And I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cravin' Cajun blend.  I also normally wear a pair of disposable plastic glove when eating this kind of food, but opted to go all natural today, and the shrimps were still piping hot. Wearing disposable gloves may help prevent your sensitive fingertips from getting burned, plus your hands will not required the through soap and hot water treatment afterward.\n\nNot into seafood served in a bag?  They also have Cravin' Cajun Baskets of Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Catfish, Fried Oyster, and Fried Shrimp served Fries.  Cravin' a Po-Boy?  They have Catfish, Crawfish Tail, Oyster, Shrimp and Cajun Sausage Po-Boys to satisfy your tummy. Still not interested???  How about their signature Etouffe, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Seafood Salad, Corn n' Crab Chowder or Lobster Bisque? They serve just about everything you could think of to order here, EXCEPT Fried Okras (Sorry Misti).\n\nAnyway, I plan to come back for dinner and try other stuff on their menu when I am more hungry.\n\nAnd in case you do not know where this soon to be popular Cajun crawfish\/shrimp\/crab\/clams boil dining destination is located at, it is in the same strip mall as a few other local Yelp favorites (China Mama, HK Star) on S. Jone Blvd, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd.\n\nService was good.  The waitress (Myrene)  was attentative, without breating down your neck. Although I would not object to that in a different setting.\n\nPrice is on par with the others. $9.99 for 1# of crawfish, $10.99 for shrimp, etc.\n\nAmbiance is pleasant, interior design work that went into the construction of this restaurant is nicely thought out (3 hand sinks!) and elegantly executed.\n\n4 stars! Yay! I'm a fan, and I will ask friends to come along later tonight :)
