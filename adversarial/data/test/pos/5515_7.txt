I made a reservation via OpenTable; simple as always. Six of us got together (my friends like to call us the \"Supper Club\") and shared everything. I'd highly recommend a group because it worked out so nicely. The space is beautiful with a great vibe. However, all of us thought it was a bit loud as we had to yell at each other to have conversation. \n\nOur server, Tien was FABULOUS! She was the epitome of the perfect server. She was very welcoming. Since we were all first-timers, she explained the menu, made food suggestions, and made sure we knew how much food was in each dish so we had enough for everyone. We really felt like she was looking out for us. She was present throughout our meal and even bought us two of their most popular desserts! As we were leaving, she offered to take a photo of our group as well. Tien went above and beyond her duties and made it a truly wonderful evening! Ask for her and you won't be disappointed!!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed our meal. There were a few stand-out dishes that I would love to eat again. There were also items that warranted shrugs, however, I'm intrigued enough by what did well to want to try the rest of the menu. \n\nDeviled Eggs ($9): Pimento cheese, whipped yolks, and Schmaltz mayo. Three to an order. These were good, but didn't taste particularly different from every other deviled egg I've had as of late. \n\nCharred Octopus ($18): Smoked potatoes, rocket, and chorizo a√Øoli. Fantastic octopus; well prepared. I loved the addiction of capers. The potatoes were nice as well.\n\nFG&J ($18): Foie gras mousse, Virginia peanuts, and housemade jelly. Very yummy! The mousse had a wonderful flavor and was very smooth. Great with the jelly on their delicious grilled bread.\n\nBaked Ricotta ($16): Truffle honey, black pepper, and gouda. This was definitely a favorite at our table. The ricotta was delicious! I loved the caramelization on top of the cheese and the side of truffle honey was a wonderful complement. Amazing with or without their bread.\n\nMushroom Flatbread ($20): Fromage blanc and gouda. A mushroom \"pizza\" with some truffle element. Nice crust. Nothing spectacular about this dish for me. Perhaps a different flatbread selection might wow me?\n\nWhole Roasted Pig Rilette ($7): YUM. I liked that this rilette was a little meatier and the flavors were fantastic! I could eat this ALL DAY (I love rilette!).\n\nBone Marrow ($12): This was also good, but it didn't have any stand-out flavors. It was just plain ol' bone marrow. I didn't go back for a second bite.\n\nPeanut Butter Lava Cake ($9): Butterscotch and Roasted Banana Brown Butter ice cream. The cake didn't interest me, but the ice cream was nice!\n\nButterscotch Pudding ($9): This was FANTASTIC. So yummy!! We couldn't get enough of it! And that Cookie Butter Crunch in it? Amazing. Home run.\n\nHoney Olive Oil Cake ($9): This beautiful olive oil cake is drizzled (slightly drenched, but I'm not complaining) with honey and served with Blood Orange Sherbet and orange segments. SO GREAT! I absolutely loved this dessert. I may have loved it more than the pudding.
