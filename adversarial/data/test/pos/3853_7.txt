This place just sucks! I had a friend insist I go there with her to get pedicures, so I gave it a shot. \n\nWe went in and because it was my first time they had me fill out paper work...real fun. What if I don't want you to know my home address and email, what if I just want you to give me a pedicure? The sourpuss who did my pedicure apparently forgot her personality and charm at home that day. I think she left them next to wherever she left her pedicuring skills. This gal barely gave me a pedicure and basically acted like she would rather be anywhere but there. I tried to be nice and engage her in some sort of conversation...she just sat there. I am not kidding. I got the world's worst pedicure, basically there was no foot massage and I just did regular polish, yet somehow I was charged $45 for this so called pedicure. And because I am not a deadbeat I tipped her $5. I know, I sent the wrong message tipping her, but I felt like it was the right thing to do. So I would have been better off getting a $20 pedicure and buying something for myself with the leftover $30. \n\nPlease do not waste your time and money at this place.
