I don't think a lot of people would drive to the Wynn to eat a burger, but if you're already there and you're craving one, Terrace Pointe Cafe does them well.  Generously sized patties, juicy and flavorful, and the bun was just delightful.  It's not the strongest memory of my last visit to Vegas, but it was pleasant nonetheless.\n\nOh yeah, and they serve lobster eggs benedict.  Sweet.
