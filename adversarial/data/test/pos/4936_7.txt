Came here for New Year's Eve dinner with 12 guests.  We were immediately seated (had prior reservations), and were surprised that they had a special menu.  I had been under the assumption they had a normal menu in addition to their special menu, but that was not the case.  \n\nNevertheless, we all had a great time.  I had a chicken dish with polenta, which wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad.  I would, however, steer clear of their pizza dish of the night, which was truffle oil, pancetta, wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes.  I think it might have something to do with seeing it reconstituted by a friend later that evening.  \n\nGood service, and good, if not memorable, food.
