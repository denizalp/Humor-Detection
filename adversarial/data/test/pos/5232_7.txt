Two words come to mind when I think of this restaurant:  DON'T BOTHER!  \n\nMy gentleman caller and I came to this restaurant at 4:30 in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost completely vacant save for a couple people at the bar. We were promptly seated by the waitress that would be serving us. The table was incredibly unstable. It wobbled so much no matter what we did. \n\nWe decided on buffalo chicken dip and two burgers. It took a while to get the appetizer which was shocking. When we finally got it, the buffalo chicken dip looked and tasted like it was microwaved and the tortilla chips were dripping in grease. We were never asked how it was by the waitress. We never really saw her but I'll get to that later. \n\nI got the Good, Bad , and the Ugly burger that was supposed to be cooked medium with fries and a side of creamy garlic sauce. I tried the fries and the garlic sauce first...the sauce was more like butter and there was hardly any garlic flavoring at all. The burger was not cooked the way I wanted it at all. The outer rim of the burger was alright, however, if the middle of the burger were any rarer it would probably have started mooing at me.  I would have said something about getting it cooked longer, but our waitress was no where to be found. And no, it wasn't busy, there were only two other tables with two and three people and she was neglecting them as much as she was neglecting us. \n\nThe only time we saw the waitress was so she could give us the check and she tried to take our baskets away from us when we still had plenty of food on it. What the hell?  And she didn't even give me a pen to sign the receipt. I had to rummage for a pen in my own purse because she was once again nowhere to be found. \n\nThis place sucks and I will not be returning. I was wondering why the place was vacant when I got there and by the time I left I knew why. P
