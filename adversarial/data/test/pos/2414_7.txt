The back room isn't open anymore as there's a newer bigger space that opened up 'recently'. By the way, found out that my almost one year old kitty is actually a girl! Her information was apparently mixed up with her litter mate. We brought her back to get her microchip double-checked and confirmed the mix up just after my first review. Ha!
