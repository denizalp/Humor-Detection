I came to The Nerd because my coworkers were raving about it and they were hosting what sounded like what was supposed to be the most epic after party after Amazing Las Vegas Comic Con.\n\nI'm not a party-goer by any means and I don't drink very often, so take what you will about this review. \n\nAfter all my friends bailed on me, I decided I was going to switch things up and try something different and actually show up to this party. The bouncer at the door was pretty cool. Ladies get in free, guys have to pay $10 cover. When I got inside, the place was pretty packed already and resembled a house party that someone would have had in high school. All the computers, billiards tables, and bowling lanes were taken. I couldn't tell who the staff was and they didn't go out of their way to help anyone, so I couldn't ask any questions. Seating was very limited, so everyone was pretty much gathered around the bar, awkwardly standing and taking up space. I had to wait a good ten minutes for a chance to get up to the bar and look at the menu. There were only four drinks on the menu, and the bartender was no help with suggestions: he's never even had anything on the menu. However, I do appreciate the nod to pop culture in terms of the cocktail names and that this bar is pretty consistent with their theme. I ordered a Black Widow's Web which was good. It was exactly the girly type of drink I was looking for and I'd order it again. \n\nFinally after twenty minutes, some seats opened up and I chatted with a friend. We laughed and had a good time. We watched one girl dance on the dancefloor by herself. It was chill. We stayed a little over an hour, but decided not to waste our time since it was the same people on the games for the whole night and nobody seemed to want to socialize.\n\nOverall, I really wanted to like the Nerd. I was hoping that maybe it would become a regular spot or that I would make a friend. But it was very disorganized and people there were pretty antisocial. I saw on Facebook that they are planning on expanding and opened another game room? So who knows, maybe I'll come back and check it out sometime, but it won't be soon. There are other bars in the area that follow the same aesthetic and have better reviews. Wish I had gone there instead.
