We were here mid-afternoon on Saturday. Our waitress was excellent. My husband loved the beef-ribs. My chicken was as ordered and okay. The kitchen was another story. \n\nThe Gordon Ramsey wanna-be in the kitchen screaming about a toaster loudly and clanging pans should be fired. He totally ruined our experience. \n\nIn addition to the fireworks in the kitchen, the plastic wrap in the applesauce was the icing on the cake. I will say that the waitress made the plastic in the food right by taking the meal off the check without our asking. \n\nAll in all, I doubt that we will be back. We will stay in Cleveland or go to Oak and Embers in Chesterland.
