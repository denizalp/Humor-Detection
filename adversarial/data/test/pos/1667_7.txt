Love this fabulous imports store.  If you love Mai Tai's come here because they carry the Trader Vic's Mai Tai mix and it's the best!  Lots of other fabulous wine selections too.  \n\nInexpensive outdoor\/indoor imported Bali like furniture, trinkets, toys, international foods, housewares, bath and soap items which smell fabulous, frames, mirrors, silver wear, pillows, curtains, lamps, chairs, picnic items, cookbooks, tea pots, sushi sets, wine glasses, tables... I could literally walk into every room in my house and find at least one thing that I bought here. \n\nSimilar to Pier I imports but not as pricey and with a lot of more options especially during the holidays. Lots of great Christmas ornaments, food items, and gift ideas. Check them out.
