What is a pasty?? and why was I pronouncing it paste-y like my skin, rather than past-ee like I am supposed to pronounce it?  Last Saturday night after the Rebels won a nailbaiter vs Boise State, we got a rita and some nachos at Paradise Cantina.  Then I decided we should continue dinner at Cornish Pasty Co. because it was nearby and everyone was rating it highly.\n\nWe sat at the bar, which has some very cold barstools!!!  There is a purse hook underneath the bar which is a great feature.  Our server was very cool, did not catch her name.  I got iced green tea which was great.  Eric R. is still not on the black tea bandwagon and only likes hot green tea, so he stuck with water rather than get British black tea.\n\nI ordered the pilgrim (roasted turkey\/chicken with grilled onions, stuffing, and sweet potato) served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce (gelled, the best!) - and Eric R. got the chicken tikka masala with the mint yogurt sauce (tahini was the other option).  While we waited for our meals to be prepared, we watched a chef in front of us at the bar prepare the lamb vindaloo pasties (what I almost ordered, and will definitely get next time).  I was intrigued because the night before, I had learned how to make dumplings.  Now in front of my eyes, a chef was making essentially a giant dumpling, using egg wash instead of water to seal the dough but crimping it similarly!  I felt my parallel universes collide.\n\nOur pasties came out piping hot and cut in half.  Eric R. learned something new about me that he didn't know (and that is hard for a married couple): that I really like gelled cranberry sauce and even enjoy the canned one.  I never think about it though so I never buy it or talk about it!  The pilgrim was very delicious.  Eric R. asked to swap halves so we ended up eating each other's first halves.  The chicken tikka masala was very moist and the curry sauce was spot on.  Eric R. thought it was a tad too spicy for him which means mild for me :)  Then we started on our second halves and ended up switching plates entirely.  He really liked the red wine gravy and I was quite happy with the CTM.\n\nThe vibe is cool and it was a hot spot just for people to drink while we were there.  It is located just north\/left of Komol.  Whenever I go to Commercial Center, I will have to choose between Cornish Pasty, Komol, and Ma Dang...that is tough!  There is an extensive vegetarian menu too.  Cheers!
