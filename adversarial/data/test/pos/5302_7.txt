Mom has been looking for yellow split peas since their move from Iowa to Vegas, not long ago.  They used to get it at Wal-Mart in Iowa!  Believe it or not, the Wal-Mart in Vegas does not have it so we went to many different markets looking, including a Filipino market that we love now for other reasons and still could not find it.\n\nTo our relief, they sell it in the bulk section for $1.99\/lbs at Whole Foods!  I called and Andy in the grocery department was super helpful!  Instead of saying, yea we have it, he told me exactly where in the store and how much it was.  Mom and dad bought 3lbs for $5.99.  Dad said they asked a lady where the split peas were, she dropped what she was doing and took them to it.  Very courteous.  They were in and out no longer than 10 minutes as I waited in the parking lot yelping lol!\n\nHonestly, I love Whole Foods for certain items.  I visit many different grocery stores throughout the month and yes I wish I could find it all at one, but overall I don't mind traveling around. \n\nAs we arrived at WF's today, Saturday, October 1st at 9:30am, the California Produce Wholesale semi truck was pulling out so I assume that the best day for produce is Saturday or maybe Sunday so that they have time to unload it all.  Next time I'm in, I will be sure to ask!
