I am always on the lookout for healthy food options so I was excited when I finally got to try this place. The bf found out about it from a friend. it's a small location off the beaten path that I never would have stumbled upon on my own.\n\nThe menu is pretty basic but large. They have breakfast options that they serve all day, along with healthy salads, acai bowls, whole wheat lavash wraps, etc. Everything on the menu is designed with health in mind. Now healthy doesn't always equate to low calorie, but at least you know you're getting something nutritious made from whole non-processed foods.\n\nWe came for breakfast so breakfast it was. I ordered the Farmer's Omelet: 3 organic brown eggs, spinach, turkey sausage and goat cheese $9.95. The bf ordered the  Healthy Oatmeal Pancakes with chocolate chips $6.95 and a shot of wheat grass. The food took a little bit to prepare but was worth the wait, it was delicious!! There were so many other things that caught my eye. I really want to come back and try an Acai bowl for sure!\n\nThe staff is really pleasant and friendly, they seemed sincere in helping us vs. just going through the motions. The atmosphere is not fabulous it reminds me of a Jamba Juice sort of feel - but the place is clean and really that's all that matters.\n\nCheck 'em out if you're in the area and looking for something healthy!
