3.5 stars\n\nI've been wanting to try this place since it opened, and since the bar at GB was full on Saturday night, we decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere is great. It is very upscale and swanky (minus the annoying video poker - which I understand is inevitable in Vegas.) \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place a higher rating is because it was surprisingly expensive (mainly for wine) $9 for a glass of house cab is a little extreme. (Especially when they have a 1\/2 carafe next door at Grimaldi's for $9.) Don't get me wrong, I know wine fairly well and am willing to pay a relatively high price for good wine. However, sometimes I just want some decent, reasonably priced wine on a Saturday night! My boyfriend's 12 oz beer was $5.50 which is slightly more reasonable. We got the chicken tenders as an appetizer and they were quite tasty. \n\nOverall I really liked this place, but  I wish the drinks were a little more affordable. $50+ for 4 drinks and an app is rather steep. We will be back, but only for happy hour (which is strangely only Mon-Thurs.)
