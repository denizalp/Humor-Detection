Saw the raveeee reviews. TL;DR- I'd hit it again at least once. Or in desperation.\n\nCustomer service is inarguably top notch. Very friendly and has a \"we want you to like it\" attitude. Too sweet? Not sweet enough? You thought you knew what you wanted but really didn't? They got your back and greet you with a warm welcome and a warm goodbye. \n\nI don't know what the rest of LV bubble tea pricing looks like, but I was slightly surprised. I told the nice girl at the counter to surprise me, and even after a Yelp check-in for a free sinker (yeah!), my total was still almost $5. So I guess I was surprised. By the price tag. It was for a green honey oolong with milk or something. That was a little alarming. Tea tasted good though.\n\nThe other reason they lose a star is for the tapioca balls. I have this obsession that the balls have gotta be just right. Can't be mush in your mouth, which is the worst. But if the balls are hard, that sucks too since your jaw gets tired eventually during this entire process. And really, it shouldn't have to be that much work. They're pretty proud that their balls are made new every 2 hours, but even if they're fresh, they're made too hard!\n\nI'd come back to give it a fair shake. The bubble tea, that is.
