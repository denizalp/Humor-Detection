One of the greatest pieces of old Toronto left in the city, \"Old\" City Hall is one of my favourite buildings.\n\nIt's massive clock tower is fabulous, but did you know that it was once going to be knocked down to make way for more modern skyscapers (back in the 60's)? Thank god that didn't happen. \n\nMy favourite thing about this spot is when the days after Remembrance day, people come to the cenotaph war memorial in the front of the old hall and place their poppies in the grass in front of it. Did you know that THAT is what you are supposed to do with your old poppies? \n\nI am full of facts. Just try me.
