This place is pretty cool.  I am truly religious to my fitness regimen and I like that i can get my fix to an S load of protein immediately following my workouts. However, prices are a little high for my liking and there are douchey fitness photos\/magazines decorating the tables, walls, and website. Get over yourself Larissa Reis. Decent place overall though.
