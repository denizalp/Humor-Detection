Bomb late night drunkin' food downtown! \n\nThe burgers were moist and delicious and the shakes were superb. Fries were carbalicious! \nWe all tried the different shakes they had and my favorite was the brownie delight.\nThey definitely satisfied the tummy! \n\nWe went on a Saturday night, so it was definitely busy with other drunkin kids. But hey, if I could remember the taste while drunk, that says a lot, right?
