TIME FOR A REAL REVIEW.  \n\nI had high hopes for this place as the the owner's brother owns a very fine Italian establishment as well.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  First off, I watched a server drop her drying rag on the floor then resumed drying off utensils with it. The food was alright.  My entree included a salad with was dressed with a balsamic vinagarette sauce.  Bread was nothing special. The chicken parmigian was a really good portion.  The red sauce was the best part of the overall dining experience.  Tiramasu tasted good for the first few bites then got unbearable because of the liquor and richness.  Canolis were had a lot to be desired.  The creamy goodness was only on the ends versus all the way through the canoli.
