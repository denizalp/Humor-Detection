One of the better Station Casinos...Even better than ones on the strip too!\nTons of food choices, huge movie theater, fun bowling alley, and great concert venue as well.\n\nWhat's not to like here? Good bonus is that you don't have to deal with the traffic situation like on the strip. Definitely a locals hot spot...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(327\/365) \"Cool Casino Without the Strip Hassle\"
