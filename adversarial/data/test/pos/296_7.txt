This is how I review an airline.\nFive stars to get me to and back safely. Lose my luggage, lose a star. Late flight, lose two stars. Canceled flight lose tree stars.  Crash? You lose all your stars! You might even lose the whole review! But don't count on that. I always buckle up.\n I really had no problems with this airline, only that they charged me 25.00 extra to take my luggage. But most airlines do this now a days, I just wish everything was added to the original ticket. The plane was a little bit old , I could tell by the ashtrays on every seat and also the stewardesses, I think they came with the plane.\nBesides that all the airlines are the same\nStewardess giving the safety instructions pointing at the emergency exits on every direction. I've heard it so many times my mind refuses to go trough it one more time. The song YMCA starts playing in my head while she does her hand  gestures  misspelling every word. Besides the chances of using the emergency exits in case of an emergency after takeoff are close to none. You make it or you don't.\n Me writing this review is a sign that I made it back and forth from my vacation with no problems. Would I use this airline again? Probably, but I don't pick airlines...I pick cheap tickets.
