I DO NOT RECOMMEND EATING HERE!!!!\n\nThe empty parking lot at 6pm on a weekday should have been a sign. We drove up and there were all but 5 cars parked there, we even wondered if it was open. \nWe (me and the family) was seated. We ordered the entrees that came with the salad bar. Every single salad item tasted old. Our entrees finally came, and we were all very disappointed, the burgers my daughters ordered were mushy, the bun covered in grease, the burger no flavor. My wife ordered fish tacos, it was mediocre. I ordered the crab cake entree, it was literally two very small cakes of what appeared to be food. It had mushy wet mixture of stuffing and mayonnaise, it was extremely undercooked. I had to separate the mush from the actual pieces of crab, or what was supposed to be crab, then left the wet mush left. The server asked if everything was ok, I told her the crab cakes were not done, she said well you seemed to eat most of it, I said \" Yes, the fish that I picked out, however I left the undercooked wet mush\" The manager came shortly after and asked if everything was okay, and before I could open my mouth she grabbed the plate of wet mush and walked away...\n\nSo...If you like gross food, and paying high a price for it, go here.... We should have gone to Culvers across the street, It would have been light years better than here...\n\nGiving 1 Star is generous...\n\nNever Again!....
