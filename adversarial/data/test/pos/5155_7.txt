Holy Hell. Just called to order delivery and got total attitude from the gargoyle answering the phone! You know who you are, we asked for delivery, not take-out and you can take your \"whatever\" and shove it down your miserable little throat...terrible customer service - I hope your boss reads this. Too bad because I'm new in the area and was looking for something against the grain but you totally ruined any chance in hell of me ever ordering anything at your little establishment...seriously, quit and find something that erases the a-hole factor in your life or become a prison guard or something...
