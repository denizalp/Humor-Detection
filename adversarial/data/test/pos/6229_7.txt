Another victim of 4.5 star rated restaurant. This is literally the worst kbbq experience I've had and this restaurant can get away with it because they have no competition in this side of town. \n\nI came here for Mother's Day with my family of 3 for the first time based on good reviews. Me and my sister ordered the moo combo to share and my mom got the bibimbap.\n\nThe moo combo said it feeds 2-3 people for 53 bucks but I'm surprised if it can even feed one person. It came with 8 thin brisket, 1 strip of pork belly and 1 strip of pork neck, 1 sirloin,  bulgogi and spicy chicken in the smallest possible portion I've ever seen.  Keep in mind these are not even quality meats either and are usually in the lunch or cheap price at ayce places.\n\nNext is service, there were 2 guys helping us, an Asian and a white guy. I honestly think something was wrong with the white guy because all he could say is \"here's that.\" Everytime he would bring our food he would only say \"here's that.\" When they forgot our steamed egg and bulgogi for 20 minutes, and I asked about it the guy brought it out and just said \"here's that,\" and when we paid and he gave us our check back all he said was \"here's that\" and nothing else. He was obviously new because he was always asking the Asian server but they should train him to be friendly and teach him manner words like \"thank you\" and \"sorry\" before teaching him anything else. \n\nNext is the ventilation. This place has some serious ventilation issue compared to all other kbbq places. My mom couldn't breathe halfway through the meal and had to go outside for fresh air. I also got a headache in the middle of our meal because of the terrible ventilation.\n\nOverall, this is probably the worst kbbq place in Las Vegas. Hugely overpriced, tiny portion, horrible service,  and ventilation issues. This is the only kbbq place in this area so they know they can get away with it. For people thinking about dining here, don't make the same mistake as us and drive a little further for a better kbbq experience.
