I've been coming here for almost 5 years now for my annual chest x-ray. In general, no real complaints,  but here's the run-down.\n\n1) They take walk-ins for chest x-rays which is helpful for me and my crazy schedule.\n2) The staff are always friendly, have never had any problems with the front desk or radiology techs. \n3) The office (including bathrooms) are always clean, and the waiting rooms have two TVs which helps the time go by while you wait.\n4) I never have much of a wait when I go here once I am checked in, but the check-in process can sometimes take 30-45 minutes, even when there are only 2-3 other patients in the entire building. Seems a little excessive to me personally, but again as I said, once I'm checked in I'm normally done with imaging and out the door in ten minutes. \n\nI also can't comment on fees\/payment or anything like that as I'm fortunate my school insurance pays for everything.
