Let me just begin with the service: It was amaaaaaaazing and sooooo engaging. NOT. It was lackluster at best. Everyone from the busser to the waitress to the sushi chef rarely smiled and did not engage us unless it was necessary. And by necessary this means coming back every 30 seconds to ask if I was ready to order (as I was clearly still reading the extensive menu). None of them wanted to be there. I don't know if something had happened there earlier, but everyone had a somber face. I actually missed work while I was at lunch because everyone at my office is happy! We had empty glasses of water and dishes sitting at our table for about 15 minutes before they realized they should probably come over and provide whatever service they provide. \n\nBlue Fin Special( In: Cajun Albacore, Cucumber \/ Out: Tuna, Salmon, yellowtail, shrimp and avocado with Chef special sauce) --- I am SOOO glad I only ordered a half roll because this was just not edible. It was the mushiest thing I've ever had the displeasure of eating.. loaded with sauces that mask the natural flavor of the fish.. I only had one piece out of the 4 because I wasn't about to force myself to eat this despite the all you can eat policy where they charge you menu price for anything you don't finish. \n\nJohnny Johnny Roll (In: Mild Spicy Soft Shell Crab \/ Out: Spicy Tuna, Avocado with Yum Yum and Spicy Ponzu Sauce) --- This wasn't as saucy\/mushy as the Blue fin roll, but it was equally as terrible. I ate two out of the four pieces.. There was just nothing special about these \"special rolls.\" The fish didn't taste fresh and the sauce was just overpowering. \n\nSpicy salmon hand roll & salmon skin hand rolls: These were good. They're very basic rolls though, so they're hard to mess up. I actually had these before anything else, so I was very excited to what was to come.. only to be disappointed!\n\nBaked green mussels --- this is served in an escargot dish.. They really skimp on the mussels.. instead of getting a whole mussel per spot, they cut them in half.. so you're eating a tiny bite that might as well be considered nonexistent considering the amount of cheese they cover this dish with. You seriously might as well ask for melted cheese, because this is what it was. I was highly disappointed by this dish, as baked green mussels are one of my all time favorite things!\n\nScallops --- omg. this was fried to shit. It almost tasted like they reused oil to fry this.. couldn't even taste the scallops! \n\nChicken katsu curry --- this was fairly tasteless.. the chicken was bland and overdone. This solely served the purpose of getting rid of my hunger -- It was uneventful and forgetful. Boooooring.\n\nI was more than happy to pay the a la carte price for all the sushi I did not finish because it was so sub-par. However, they were gracious enough to not financially or digestively punish me in this situation. They simply removed it and hopefully gave it a proper burial.\n\nHOWEVER, the highlight in this discovery is that this would be a great restaurant to take your companion if you wanted to break up. It's private, everyone's in a bad mood already, and the parking is close.
