We stopped by Sunday afternoon for brunch on a recommendation from a family member. The wait was 45-60 minutes, but we got skipped over on the list and it was more like an hour and ten minutes. \n\nWe finally sat, then waited another 10 minutes before the water guy came. Another 5 before the waiter came and brusquely asked what we wanted. Another 30 went by before we gave up and left since the couple before us gave up and left and they had been seated about 15 minutes before us. \n\nThe service was terrible, we were basically ignored. After the one couple left, their food came out and the waiter just started passing it around, being fairly rude about it. We weren't unique, the entire restaurant was full of people and we saw four dishes come out in 30 minutes and only three tables had food. \n\nIf you're looking for a up to two hour wait for food and iffy service, this is your place. It certainly won't be somewhere we would return to. As a small business owner, I'm appalled at the lack of service and inability to deliver food to that many waiting customers on a busy afternoon.
