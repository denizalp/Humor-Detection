Horrible quality furniture, incredibly bad customer \"service\" and they do not stand by their warranty.  To put the icing on the cake, they are now inundating my mailbox with offensive quantities of their catalogs.  They are clearly grasping at straws to sell their sub-par furniture. \n\nFor the record, I boycott any company that chooses to violate my time and space by clogging up my mailbox as well as killing trees to have catalogs printed on thick paper.  this company is outrageously unethical.\n\nIn case someone from Arhaus is reading this, I would appreciate it if you would STOP sending these IMMEDIATELY.  The code number on one of the catalogs is PCK-4936 PLT-43
