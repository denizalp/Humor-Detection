Caveat 1:\nWe did this on a Groupon so our choices were limited. Overall the food was good. The service well....\n\nFriendly. Everyone was friendly but oblivious. Example: seated at a table for 4 the extra settings were never cleared and just left to crowd the table. Between courses empty plates sat on the table for 5 -10 minutes while servers passed repeatedly empty handed. \n\nThe Groupon menu had no descriptions on it. For instance the choice of mains were listed as  \"Lamb or Salmon or Ratatouille.\" etc. No explanation of what the preparation or sides were. When my wife inquired as to what the salmon was like and how was it prepared we were told \"grilled\" .... yep. that's all we got. Once we ordered there was no bread or anything brought to the table. Not compulsory to bring a nosh but we're sitting 10 - 15 minutes waiting. Appetizers were good. When The 2nd course came out. The soup was delicious. The salad my wife ordered was fine. Then 5 minutes later we were brought another set of soup and salad which we declined. The waitress was very confused and flustered. The mains:  I had the lamb which was very good. I'd like to tell you what it was served with I think it was grits.. but again there was nothing on the menu describing the preparation or sides so I'm guessing. My wife had the ratatouille over rice which wasn't mind blowing but was nicely seasoned and tasty.\n\nCUTLERY. I know it's weird and might sound picky but beautiful design, nice to look at, impossible to use. Maybe it was just the fork. But it was so sleek and cylindrical that as a result when I tried to hold something for cutting it kept rolling between my fingers. I have never complained about cutlery before in a restaurant and I know how stupid it sounds but so annoying. It just one of those small details that add up over a night of little things taking away from the meal.\n\nWe ordered wine when we arrived. Never during the four courses did anyone ask if we wanted another drink. When dessert was served we were never asked about coffee or tea. We finished dessert and had to flag someone down after ten minutes for the bill. \n\nIn my Groupon experience when a bill is given usually the REAL meal total is on the bill then discounted so the customer can base the tip on what the food's actual value is. This was not on the bill. Very frustrating. I guessed. Also,  the waitress hovered over my shoulder as I was figuring out the tip which just screams inexperience to me. \n\nThe jazz band that was playing was great. The decor is nice, although the exterior for some inexplicable reason still remains uninviting. \n\nI will stress this: The FOOD WAS GOOD. My lamb was really good. All four courses were tasty but the service was not up to par. I may try this place again but I will give them some time to get up to speed and work the kinks out.
