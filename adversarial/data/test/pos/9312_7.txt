Tried and True.\n\nThis place is a relic-- it's been there as long as I've been here-- well over a decade. This low-pro, slightly sub-street level enclave, set among a slew of other businesses on the streetfront, has but one thing on the menu: Pizza.\n\nSlices go for about $3.75, and are \"Pizza Pizza\" size. It's always fresh, and free spice is provided on the countertop. There's no place to sit in the approximate 15x15 ft ordering space and commoners are often seen lounging about on nearby staircases outside the shop, and along the edges of the inside of the restaurant, eating, standing against ledges.\n\nThis is a late night place. It's definitely THE desination for revellers spilling out bars at 2. I've ordered a pizza from this place at 6 AM, even, and I don't think I've seen it open for lunch ever. The chalkboard menu is classically defiled every time the staff rewrites it: For example, \"Crab\" mysteriously becomes \"Crap\".\n\nDespite the shoddiness, I haven't found a reason to stop going here for late night bites yet-- and the staff are always friendly.
