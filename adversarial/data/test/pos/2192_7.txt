My wife and our kids went to Red Robin around 8pm on a Saturday night after swimming for most of the day.  We were tired and very hungry.  I like to bring the kids here because they are usually entertained by the activities at the table that are there for them.  They usually color something, read, watch television, or worse case I'll bring out the Ipad!\n\n\n     This night there were a lot of kids here because there was a soccer tournament in town.  So we had to wait a little bit but not too long.  I really like their kid's menus here.  Even my daughter eats here and she is so picky!  It's good for kids and it's loud so I don't have to tell them to talk more softly.  \n\n\n     For me and the wife the food was ok.  My wife loves burgers but they never get it right for her here.  I always get the Whiskey BBQ and I really like that burger.  No complaints.  What I didn't like was my bottomless sweet potatoes fries.  I got a few orders of fries but they were like the bottom of the basket fries.  They always come like this so I don't think that I'm just getting unlucky either.  I had to start stealing my kid's fries!  My wife did like her bottomless salad.  That helped but overall I say we come here more for the kids than for a gourmet burger for ourselves.  \n\n\n     They do always have good beer on tap here so that is always a plus.  Service is usually ok nothing too bad.  Just watch playing those electronic games at your table because they will charge you!  The devices on the tablr now show you the menu, your bill, and you can pay from there too.  It is neat.  I would give this Red Robin a 3 if it was just my wife and I out for the night but I will give them a 4 just because it's a good place to take our kids and still have an enjoyable dinner.
