Polished service. Delicious foodporn worthy food . Beautiful space. Well done. 4.5 stars \n\nPretty easy to find since it's a standalone restaurant right on the strip in front of Caesars Palace. Arrived around noontime and there were plenty of seats at the bar which later filled up. Pretty much everywhere in Vegas hospitality\/service is on point and this was right up there. I don't watch the show and I appreciated my bartender recommending their signature dishes. \n\nLOBSTER RISOTTO $25 -  Perfection. The butter poached lobster was flavorful and fresh, pretty generous portion too. I liked how it was precut into bite sized pieces. The risotto was rich and creamy, with crispy onions providing some texture. MUST ORDER. (10\/10)\n\nPAN SEARED SCALLOPS $24 - Had the surf and turf going on with the soft bacon lardons. The sweet corn puree brought sweetness. Great coloring on the scallops, if there was harder sear for texture or something crisp to contrast the softness, this could be a perfectly balanced dish. (8.5\/10) \n\nPINEAPPLE CARPACCIO $11 - w\/ citrus foam, coconut sorbet, coriander, passionfruit. Spectacular with the dry ice presentation. The people next to me both took pics\/vids of my dessert. (8\/10)\n\nMEET YOUR MAKER - $14 - Maker's, Domaine de Canton (ginger liquer), mint, apple, strawberry, cinnamon. Well done. Refreshing and the foam kept it interesting.
