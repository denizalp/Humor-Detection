I had never been to a Jason's Deli before.  But, now that I have, I must say that I agree with the overall 4-star rating this establishment currently enjoys.  Chicken Noodle Soup with tender morsels of chicken, carrots, and thick noodles was hot and with a distinctly flavored chicken broth that was more robust than most.  My Ham & Hard Salami Quarter-Muffaletta was packed with meat that melded well with the minced olives and tasted great after being squeezed together by the top and bottom of the delicious yielding, toasted, and sesame-covered New Orleans style bun.\n\nAnd, Diane's Beefeater was packed in a soft French Roll with even more lean meat and a huge expanse of well-melted Provolone Cheese.  A generous amount of hot au jus stood by in a bowl for serious dunking.  It was redolent of beef, with a rich flavor of meat juices that tasted great!  Pickle spears were good, but chips just the type that had been poured out of a commercially sold bag.\n\nThe place is nothing fancy, but it is serviceable and comfortable, with plenty of table and booth seating available to accommodate a large lunchtime crowd.  Table tops were continually in the process of being cleared and cleaned by a large and efficient staff as soon as a diner got up and began to leave.  \n\nOn this occasion I found a Quarter-Muffaletta to be adequate.  But next time I am going to attack a Half-Muffaletta, and see if I can handle it in one sitting.  A Whole-Muffaletta is a beast that would be more suitable for an episode of \"Man vs. Food!\"
