I had heard much about this place and had high expectations. I tried five different cocktails from the list only one was close to balanced. Everything was a bit too sweet or much too sweet. I had much better cocktails and at Noir Bar, Rhumbar and from Lucas at Carne Vida. Of the cocktails I had at Downtown Cocktail Room my favorite would be the Rob Rooigon. The worst was the 318 which was so impossibly sweet. It was pretty much undrinkable. They may have one of the only Kold Drafts in Vegas, but it won't make a bad cocktail good.\n\nI might give it a try again.
