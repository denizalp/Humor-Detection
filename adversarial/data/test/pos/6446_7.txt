Pineapple basil drink is tasty and the service is friendly but their carne asada tacos have to be one of the worst I've had in town and ridiculously overpriced given its size, quality and location. Tacos El Gordo and Taco y Taco tacos are not only much tastier but much cheaper and represents a greater value in every sense of the word. I'm quite disappointed given how it's expensive these tacos are. I wouldn't even buy it at $1 unless they improve the quality. Their habanero sauce is also similarly tasteless without the proper smoky fruitiness naturally present in habanero peppers.\n\nTacos from Me Gusta taste like subpar, overpriced tacos from the east coast. My apologies to the owner and cooks but there needs to be a serious revamping of the standard tacos.
