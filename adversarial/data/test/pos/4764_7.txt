Been going here for years to people watch and have drinks...past three times I have ate there and wasnt impressed. The seabass is extreamly fishy and last night I ordered the Mahi Mahi...it was dark and tasted like chicken.  I had to fill up on pretzel bread because waiter didnt come back for 30mins after serving the food :(
