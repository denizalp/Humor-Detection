This has been my go-to mani\/pedi spot for 6 years now. It's nothing fancy, but it's clean, friendly and they do a good job. They are great at remembering your name and ask about the kids...just super friendly. I only get regular manicures, but I hear their gels are great.\n\nAlso there is cute little kid chairs, so you can take your little mini-you to get their nails done. My daughter LOVES going.\n\nSo yeah...I'm a fan. :)
