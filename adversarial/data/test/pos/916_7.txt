Regal is upgraded, baby!!! Love the new recliner seats. Plenty of room in front of the seats to walk down the aisles without bugging the other movie-goers. I like that you can choose your seats when you buy tickets, but I can see how this might slow the line down. We went at a very off-peak time and the theater was empty. The employee helped me choose the seats and sat us next to a party of 4 despite the theater being practically empty. \n\nThe stars off really comes from the fact that you need to walk through a smokey casino to get here. There's no good entrance where you can bypass at least most of the casino. I think Station and Regal really need to work together to sort out a separate entrance that can at least get you past most of the casino because I don't feel comfortable walking through here with kids. \n\nOverall, an average theater with upgraded seats in a smokey casino. Not horrible; not the best.
