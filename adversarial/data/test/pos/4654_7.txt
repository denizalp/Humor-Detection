Not bad, not bad at all.  Can't really say anything spectacular about this place, can't really say anything horrifying about it either...  \n\nI came here for lunch with my coworkers and we had a blast.  We would of had a blast anywhere regardless where we were... The restaurant is pretty clean, and the decorations are very inviting and nice.  The staff was super attentive and super nice....even butted in our conversations and took it to the next level, which was pretty cool I think.  The food was good, portions was great, we shared a pizza and some pasta.\n\nOverall a good experience I have no reason not to come back.
