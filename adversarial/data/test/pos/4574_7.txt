OK so I came for the midnight special of the $4.95 steak and eggs. There was a bit of a wait but dude for $4.95, I expected there to be a line. We got seated after around 10 minutes. So steak and eggs. Steak is 7oz and probably not going to be cooked the way you want it. I asked for medium rare and got like a medium well. Kind of total opposite of the spectrum but I am not going to complain because I saw this coming for the price. Overall though, even though it wasn't cooked right, the value for what you get is something you can't complain about. You get eggs, steak, hash browns, and toasts. On top of that, the service was pretty good. The server came by several times to ask us if we needed anything. She was kind and I couldn't have asked her to redo the steak.\n\nOther deals also available at night. Would probably not come at other times but maybe the food might be a bit better during non-peak times and not with these value prices. If you are near South Point though at night and looking for a hearty meal, I say go for it! (But don't be ubering here after a night of clubbing on the strip unless u are literally staying at South Point of M Resort...)
