This  place so completely failed to make an impression on me that I almost forgot we were here. We stopped in for something to drink on a HOT Las Vegas afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered two Absolute and Cranberries. Our Bill was $30.00! That's high even for Vegas. In my younger days, the very attractive staff might have been enough to draw me back here, but not anymore.
