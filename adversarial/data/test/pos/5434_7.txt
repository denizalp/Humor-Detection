My cousin was in town from Hawaii for the SEMA convention and we were driving through Downtown...I kid you not that we almost got into an accident because he did an illegal U-turn once he saw the Rick's Restoration sign on the corner.\n\nWe parked on a dirty road that lead to an area with fake vintage storefronts. It reminded me of Toon Town. But, without the cartoon characters. If that makes sense.\n\nThere was a free tour that they were offering so, we walked in their \"lobby\" of sorts while we waited. VIntage surfborads, signage, jukeboxes, games, etc. Very neat. \nThe 10-15 minute tour took you around their shop from when they receive item, how they restore it, and to the finished product(s).\n\nI was amazed that this place even existed. Especially in Downtown Las Vegas!
