Horrendous customer service. I went to container park with my kids and as we were leaving we stopped in to get some candy. My son wanted a lollipop as he was reaching for the one he wanted he bumped another one and it fell to the floor. The guy working there ask me for it as I handed it to him I apologized for the accident. After we picked out what we wanted we went to pay. When we were ready to leave the guy said I had to pay for the broken one first before he would sell me anything else. I told him it was an accident he said I still had to pay. I can understand if my son was not being careful but the store is small and not much room. A couple of customers with kids heard what was going on and left
