Twice I've gotten bad oysters here (didn't eat them, but they smelled truly rotten\/foul). On a separate occasion, a friend of mine got food poisoning from his entree. The servers or members of the kitchen staff may have poor hygiene, and\/or there may be quality control issues in the back of the house. \n\nOn yet a third visit a server once spilled most of a glass of gewurtzraminer on my brand new yellow silk dress. This may make one wonder why I continue to go back. The reason USED to be a good wine list and live music. At least until they decided to switch to a bizarre smoked and salted fish motif. But now? I don't think anything can save them. This place is going under fast.\n\nLast, former University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Wiley is there like ALL THE TIME, sitting at the bar by himself. It's starting to freak me out.
