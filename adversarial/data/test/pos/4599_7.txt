I can't really complain about this hotel - especially since it's such a great deal. I think split between 2 gfs and I, it came out to about 50\/60 a person? We left Friday morning and came home on Sunday, and if we wanted to stay, we could have had Monday comp'ed. So I really can't complain.\n\nIt's pretty clean, even if the decor and furnishings are a bit outdated, and this with somewhat a renovation. Glad that there's not really a bad ciggie smell that's associated with some of the more budget friendly hotels. \n\nBally's is right next to Paris, across from the Bellagio, right in the heart of Las Vegas. Valet - free as usual, wherever you stay. Just don't forget to tip!!! hehe.\n\nThere's a casino, filled with smoke (sigh). I just want them to have a ciggie free casino. Please? :) But the good thing is that the tables are pretty decent - some at $5, some at $10 minimum - as compared to some of the other premium hotels that start at $15. \n\nI'd come back for a budget friendly Vegas trip!
