Not a fan of:\n1. Slow service. My date and I were seated right away, but waited at least 15 minutes before our server came over. The food came out very quickly, so that sort of made up for it, but our server still didn't come around very often after she initially took our orders.\n\n2. Pickled onion overload on my ground beef and chicken tacos. Easy enough to pick off, but I think next time I'll probably ask for my tacos without the pickled onion party on top.\n\nDefinitely a fan of:\n1. Taco Tuesday prices! I am so glad we decided to see what the hype was all about, because it was WAY worth it. I had 3 tacos, my date had 4, and we had 3 margaritas between us - barely more than $20 after tip. Such a great deal.\n\n2. Deeelicious tacos. One of my favorite things about good tacos is the tortilla, and Diego's nailed it (warm and flexible, but not falling apart). Generous and tasty fillings, too.\n\n3. The margaritas. I've had margaritas at Pasqual's, and Diego's comes in at a VERY close second. (For a classic lime margarita on the rocks, it might actually be better. Must drink more margaritas to confirm.) Great balance of sweet and tart, and none of that nasty aftertaste you get when you go too heavy on the tequila.\n\nTwo words: Taco Tuesday. You won't regret it. (Sorry, six words. Oops.)
