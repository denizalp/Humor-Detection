Came in and ordered food to go, a beef and wings.  I asked her 3 times to make sure the BBQ sauce was on the side and in the bag...\n\nI get home and there was no sauce...how incompetent can a person be?\n\nLast few experienced here have not been good...\n\nTime to find a new place.. the food is good when prepared properly, but just way too many hit and misses to continue to give this place my business.
