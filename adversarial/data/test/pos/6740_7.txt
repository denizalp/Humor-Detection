HORRIBLE!!!! Paid for a 50 min facial and only received a 40 min facial. The girl would not shut up!! She spent more time out of the room and cleaning her \"tools\" than she did on my face. When I said I had 10 more min left she started arguing with me!! I mentioned to the gal at the front desk that I only received 40 min all she said to me was \"I don't know, I wasn't in the room\" Seriously!! This place is a joke....its a dump, you don't feel like your at a spa you feel like your at the doctors office. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
