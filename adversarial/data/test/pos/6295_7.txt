This place was recommended to me when I complained about the lack of take-out options in my neighbourhood. This is definitely a welcomed food option in Brockton Village.\n\nThe sandwiches are pretty heavy-duty. I got the chicken something-or-other the first time I ate here and it was pretty damn delicious, and quite filling. We also split some fries, but I didn't really care for them. They were quite dry and sort of tasted like Shake & Bake sprinkled on potatoes. The last time I ate here I grabbed the breakfast sandwich, and felt like I was going to have a heart-attack while eating it (in a good way). Probably not good for my ticker, but was great for my tummy. Also got a salad, which seemed visually bland, but was very tasty.\n\nThe place is expensive. $10 for a sandwich seems like a lot to me, but I guess you're getting some good quality eats. It's not something I can afford to eat on a regular basis but I've certainly been back a few times. I hope they expand their menu a little more though -- only about a half dozen sandwich options at the moment.
