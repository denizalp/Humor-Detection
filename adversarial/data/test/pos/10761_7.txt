Some notes in no particular order: \n\n-Get here early to park. Like at least a half hour early. Maybe come even earlier and eat dinner nearby. \n-The lights are lovely.\n-They have a movie playing on a big screen - we saw The Santa Clause. Very cool.\n-You're paying for tickets if the kiddo wants to ride any rides.\n-There are a ton of festival foods here, including kettle corn, chocolate dipped strawberries, noodles, pizza, frozen cheesecake, strawberry lemonade, cotton candy, and candy apples.\n-Vendor booths and booths to donate to organizations like Boy Scouts.\n-The Christmas large tree lit up is quite a sight.\n\nThere are a lot of people. Crazy busy. I thought it was weird how people think this is the sort of place where you can dress up in full random furry animal costumes and superhero costumes. Did I miss the pseudo-ComiCon memo?
