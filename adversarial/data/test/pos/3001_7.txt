This location is quite special.  It is fancy, huge, bright and lots of seating.  I really like their bar stool area especially with the street view and comes with their superbly, magnificent marble table! This location is also not far from the CN Tower, in fact; you can see it sitting down at their bar stools while enjoying your favorite beverage. By the way, they even provide you wireless charging! That is a huge plus for me!! \n\nSecond Cup in my humble opinion, would be considered like Peet's Coffee in the US, great coffee, except nicer, fancier and has a \"Frenchy\" influence.  I didn't know they have more than 300 location in Canada and growing!! Some I was told are Franchised, and quite possibly this one, which made sense since it seemed to cater to its neighborhood and customer service was excellent!!  I \"gotta\" tell \"ya...\"   they made me a super duper, cappuccino that put a smile on my face, and.... my cupcake which I forgot what the flavor was since it was that good... was out of this world, fantastic!! \n\nIf you are in the downtown Toronto area on King Street, come pay a visit to Second Cup and enjoy their comfy sitting area where you will have a room with a view, a wireless charging and plenty of charging ports. Best of all, they will provide you excellent coffee and service!!\n\nUntil then, bonjour and be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p
