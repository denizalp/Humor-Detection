I'm not a big fan of Bank of America, but I have to go there to do business from time to time.  This branch is very close to my house and convenient.  The tellers here aren't as friendly as other B of A branches that I visit, but they get the job done.\n\nThere's not a whole lot to say other than it's very convenient.\n\nWill I return?  Yes, out of necessity.
