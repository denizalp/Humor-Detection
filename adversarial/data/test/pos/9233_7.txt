This place will stink up your whole outfit. Forget about going anywhere after dinner. You need to jump into shower and burn all your clothing to kill this stench. It's strong as curry, and, once you are exposed in it, you will grow to love. However for the love of everyone else in town, please go straight home.\nBecause of the smell, you know you stumbled upon on some real Chinese Turk restaurant. \nI'm okay with their food. Maybe I'm not that much of a fan for Chinese Turk food other than the skewers. It's a good exp to eat here once in a while. I haven't found anything on the menu that's my fave. More than half of their menu is just normal Chinese restaurant food you can find anywhere else.
