The best part of this HUGE HUMONGO sandwich is the cream cheese.  The cream cheese compliments the sandwich and boosts taste by like a million.  It's THAT good. \n\n***On the menu it states how many calories your consuming with each sandwich..... and just fair warning.... it's DELISH and will consume ALL your calories for the day and probably for the next day.   IT IS HUGE! \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the Santa Cruz COLD.  Pastrami, avocado, bacon, and cream cheese.  A small is 790 calories.... OF YUM.  They don't skimp on the fillers believe me.... They hook it up with a fat sandwich.  \n\nThe Haole Cheesesteak is definitely an amazing hot sandwich worth trying.  \n\nIt is a fairly new place, and there are a lot of friendly faces to recommend and help you out.  DUDES! come and try something!  It's a cute little place off of Eastern in a really busy plaza.  It's surrounded by a lot of good eats, but definitely come and try this place.  There's a nice seating area outside, and lots of seating inside too.  \n\nOn the weekend they have a nice little farmers market and The Beach Hut Deli would be an ideal place to grab some lunch for sure.  \n\n I work in this plaza and when Friday comes around I'm usually the first to want to grab some lunch from there when I want consume ALL my calories for the day.  :P  It's worth it!
