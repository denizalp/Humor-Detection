Finally got to have their well known lobster rolls !!\n\nGreat restaurant , very good food ! Lobster rolls were  very delicious. We loved the crab dip too ! Love all the lighting ( from old ships ) . \n\nWe can not wait to come back ! Halibut looked great and heard the clam chowder is yummy ! \n\nAnd Scott behind the bar is so funny and very knowledgeable!
