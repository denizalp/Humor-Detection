Its absolutely shocking that I am giving so many stars, and even more shocking what a great time we had here.\n\nNY NY in general has always skeeved me out.  It seems its actually a lil better these days. Its a super small \"club\" more like a bar actually.  \n\nMusic was ok, I dont know who listens to hip hop anymore but it was really good mix.  The saloon go go dancers\/MC etc. are actually pretty amazing entertainment; those chicks work their asses off and its super fun!  I would say good to come with a group of people.
