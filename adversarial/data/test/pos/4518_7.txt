\"Find THE long hallway!\" Tucked in on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. Definitely is no \"secret\" when this hidden gem has been a good spot for \"drunchies.\" \n\nHow did we find it? \nFollowed the flock of people holding their slice of pizza. We knew we were close the moment we saw people devouring their slice.\n\nI've had this place bookmarked for years & finally had the chance to try it as we're staying at the same hotel of its location.\n\n* Verdict:\nIf I could remember, LOL! It was good, but way overpriced for a slice! Gotta pay by the slice.\n\n$5.00 for cheese pizza\n$5.50 for 1 topping pizza\n\nFor 5 slices, I don't know how we ended up paying for 2 slices of cheese pizza because we got 2 pepperonis, 2 pepperoni & mushrooms, & 1 cheese garlic ricotta slice. \n\nI would say a good decent size, but not filling enough for a hungry person. I just like how this place is popular for being a \"secret\"!
