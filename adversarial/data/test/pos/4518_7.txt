This place is amazing!  My wife and I stopped in while visiting my family in Brunswick.\nWe ordered the ham, cinnamon apple and brie crepe. The apples were sprinkled with cinnamon and cooked, but still had bite to them.  Went well with the ham and brie.  Delicious!\nWe also had the egg, spinach, bacon and swiss crepe.  Fresh spinach and crispy bacon made for a perfect breakfast.  \nOnly disappointment was the place was empty on a Saturday morning.  C'mon people, put down your bagels and check this place out.  You will not be disappointed!
