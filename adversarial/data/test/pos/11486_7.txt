This place is amazing! A friend recommended this place and said this place is packed all night. We got there around 8:45pm and waited about 20 min. I was skeptical about the AYCE on sushi but my friend was right, the food was very high quality and fresh. Sushi House Goyemon has a full bar and good selection of sakes.\nWe had so many orders of everything (see pics ) but the stand outs were the Ama Ebi, special grilled white tuna, and the grilled pork belly. Everything on the menu comes in small portions only 1 or 2 small pieces but the wait staff service was spot on even though there was no an empty seat for 5 min the entire night. There is a time limit for the AYCE and it's mostly to turn over the tables. \n\nTip\n\nOrder several items a once\nThe portions are small but tasty so you try more\nReorder the item you really like.\nExpect a wait but the hostess is nice and will even call your cell when your table is ready\n\nHighly recommended, Great food, nice decor, exceptional service and did I mention the price $26.95
