Just a casual Tuesday night throwing Axes....!\n\nI was intimidated at the though of throwing an Axe, but the workers made it so fun! They were all very welcoming and excited about Axe throwing. It showed through their teaching. They were also very good about the safety aspect of axe throwing.\n\nThe set up was very nice: practice two handed, practice one handed, GAMES!\n\nHaving everyone pick their own unique nickname was a great touch to the evening.\n\nThe workers were all very knowledgeable on axe throwing and could give you advice when your (my) axe didn't stick in the wood!\n\nI would highly recommend to anyone who wants a fun time out with friends or family.
