I've tried the big 3: In N Out, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. And of these three once-regional chains, In N Out is by far my least favorite. \n\nThe fries are inedible. For purity's sake, I tried them plain, with just cheese, and animal-style. Each time, the fries seized up into a warm potato brick almost immediately after serving. \n\nThe burger is a decent burger, I will give them that. But they have never gotten my order right. I wouldn't care so much except that I have numerous severe food allergies. I asked for a single cheeseburger, plain, with pickles and ketchup. What did I get? A double double with cheese, lettuce, onions, and mustard. I ate it because I was starving... But it's like a normal-size version of White Castle. Not worth the trip across I-15.\n\nThe iced tea was decent and the burger was filling, but I will not return for a fourth visit.
