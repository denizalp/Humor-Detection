I'm a fan of the movie, the Lebowski Burger and Gold rush wings. Great place to grab lunch or dinner or late night snack. It is a sports bar and it can get boisterous but I like that atmosphere every now and then. The lighting in the evening is dim, which can make a night out with the hubs seem romantic until I get Gold sauce all over my fingers, but not so dark that you struggle to read the menu. Seating is sometimes limited for large parties, but we never had a problem with 2 or 3. \n\n We come here once or twice a month and  I oscillate between the Lebowski Burger (Angus burger topped with roast beef and queso on a weck roll) and the Gold wings. Definetly a Yankee thing to have to pay extra to swap chips for fries or any other side but not a deal breaker. The garlic fries are good but I usually try to order a salad when I get the Lebowski Burger. \n\n'Dat burger. Mmmm. 'Dat burger. So thick and juicy! I think the caraway seeds and salt on the Weck roll is what sets it above all other burgers. Or it could be the queso sauce. I keep saying I will try the beef on weck or some other entree but I haven't had the willpower yet. It calls to my soul and I give in almost every time. \n\nWings. Yup. They know what they're doing. Gold Wings are a sweet, spicy tangy sauce and the wings are perfectly crisp. I could eat 20 by myself. Okay, maybe 30 if I was starving and had no haters dining with me, but I usually split 10 with the hubs for an app. \n\nThey have daily specials (I always want to come here for the Monday Date Night special - 2 burgers for $12 - but we never seem to make it over there).  We've been for the Wednesday Wing special before (1\/2 price wings) but I probably will never do that again. I have a lack of self control around chicken wings.
