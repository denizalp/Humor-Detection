I eat a lot of spicy food and I'm here to tell you they don't fuck around\n\nLunch here is a really good deal. Unfortunately you can't get all the items they list on the dinner menu. They have screwed up orders for me a couple times but I don't really care because it is all good. You could honestly just throw darts at their menu and you'll be fine
