The two negative reviews below seem outrageous to me because every single time I visit everyone I encounter is accommodating and amenable. I sense a little bit of self-projection here. :-\/\n\nBack to my context - I had a lot of work done: crowns, fillings, deep cleaning, bridge.\n\nAll completed in less than 60 days.  I was adamant about getting the procedures completed because I commute to SF for work every so often. \n\nThey even took care of my partner. She had 4-5 filings that required immediate attention. \n\nPersonality-wise Dr.Holland was friendly and receptive to my request. He was the perfect balance of cool, calm and collected.\n\nDid I say he is the most meticulous dentist I've ever been to.  I've been to over 20+ dentist in my lifetime and I only choose the best from Yelp. \n\nI had to give Dr.Holland a try regardless of what folks say here because my partners parents gave me a referral I could not refuse.  From traditional word of mouth, they said \"Dr.Holland will not rip you off. He will only work on necessities and he is very honest.\"\n\nAny one lacking duplicity is 5stars in my book. Coming from the Bay, I've encountered and been fooled a couple times. \n\nNot any more.  \n\nThanks Dr.Holland and team for restoring my faith in your industry.
