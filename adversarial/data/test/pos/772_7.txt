I bought a Living Social deal for three up front. Considering I've never done this before, though am aware of how (ahem) personal a Brazillian could be, I was incredibly nervous. True, within three minutes of meeting Deyna I was without my pants and spread-eagle, but I can't imagine a single person other than Deyna making me feel very comfortable like that. She explained everything she was doing, kept the conversation going so I didn't die of embarassment, and she complimented me on my (for lack of a better word) performance.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend her!!
