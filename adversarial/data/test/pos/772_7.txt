This place is a straight JOKE! If it were possible to rate negative stars I would. Wait times are horrible, n god forbid u have an emergency n have to do a walk in, yer social security number will expire before u get to see the doctor! I once waited here for 2 hours before I was able to get my teenage son in to be seen when he was severely depressed due to being bullied at skool, n was having such a hard time coping while also dealing w side effects from a medication that was forced onto my kid over n over again, despite the many times I told the doctor that it made him lethargic n seemed to exacerbate his already downtrodden spirits. He said, Keep taking the medicine, it will get better...nope, it got worse...\n       The front receptionists are CURT on a good day, n outright RUDE any other day. Their catty tones are far from professional, n they seem to take pleasure in arguing w the patients whom they are supposed to be helping. The available appointments don't offer much flexibility, n they treat u like a second class citizen if u walk in. They have never returned a single phone call that I have left w their answering system, n the answering service nvr has any answers to anythn...Well thn, why do they hav an answering service whn all they ever say is to call back whn the office is open?  Both doctors at this location operate on an I don't care basis. While doctor Gupta is the nicer of the two specimens, he is rather hasty to get u in n get u out, often finishes my sentences for me as if impatient for my answer, or rattles off an impersonal, \"Yes, yes, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.....\" accompanied by a let's get on w it rolling hand motion on the right n note scribbling on the left. Whenever I leave his office I sit in my car for a second n wonder what just happened. \n       Dr. Izabella on the other hand seems more like a patient than a doctor. She is always looking as if lacking sleep, wears almost exactly the same exact outfit every time I've seen her for the past 7 years, n is even more disgruntled than her disgruntled office staff...I do not recommend thm if u hav any hopes of ever gettn any better...
