I go here quite a bit for lunch as its relatively close to my work and I refuse to eat Subway ever since I found out they have hi-fructose corn syrup in their bread.   Well I read that on the internet (along with stuff about hi-fructose corn syrup being bad) so it has to be true right?  The Internet would never steer me wrong.\n\nI tend to stick with the Salmon Melt on Wheat with no cheese and light spread.  It's basically some precooked chunks of smoked salmon which are recooked and placed on the bread, avocado and the veggies you choose and then smothered in some spicy sauce.  The process of the salmon would normally bother me but then I realize I'm paying $8.99 for it and a bag of chips and it's quite tasty so I get over it quickly.   I really like the wheat bread here, and with the salmon melt they usually give two extremely thick pieces of it (I'm thinking they might do this to better stabilize the toppings.   I've had other cold sandwiches and the pieces of bread haven't been thick.  Could all just be a giant coincidence if you believe in those)   There have been a few times I forgot to hold the cheese and I braved through it lactose intolerance notwithstanding.   Naturally it was even better with the pepperjack cheese smothering everything in between the bread.   Reason #5156 why I hate my life.  \n\nI've also tried the Cajun Turkey with Avocado sandwich, as well as their roast beef.   I found both of these to be worthwhile of a visit as well but overall not as good as the Salmon Melt.   Service is always okay, though it does sometime seem rushed.  A giant line of people is a good enough reason for me to explain that, so no points deducted on that one.  We've also tried delivery a few times without any issues (quick and efficient)\n\nOverall I can't find much fault with making Heidi's a lunchtime decision, especially over Subway.  Now I eagerly await someone to let me know Heidis uses hi-fructose corn syrup in their avocado, or to send me a youtube link to corn farmer propaganda on the health benefits of hfcs.   Get at me.
