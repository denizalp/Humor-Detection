I went there yesterday only because I had to wait for my dog to be groomed at the groomer's next door. So I only ordered the super basics: shrimp tempura, spicy salmon roll with Sapporo beer (on tap). \n\nUnfortunately, although the battered shrimps tasted good, they were definitely not shrimp tempura. They were literally just battered shrimp. \n\nThe spicy salmon were very \"meh\".  Not bad tasting, but other than being larger, they were no more flavourful than spicy salmon I can easily and cheaply get from T&T Supermarket. \n\nLast but not least...flat beer. The Sapporo beer was flat flat flat. \n\nSpent $20 for all of the above, it's not worth the number of unnecessary calories that entered my body.
