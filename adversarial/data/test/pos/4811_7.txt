Have you ever had a roommate that moved to the other side of the continent and left their room in such disarray that left you thinking that you will never get your deposit back?  Then you had to figure out a way to get a day-off from work just to clean up the mess in a master bedroom and bath all by yourself?  The mess was like a 12 gallon trash can and a year of dust exploded onto the floor and walls and the shower had a thick film that looked like it was never cleaned since 2009.  There was also a dead spider in the shower.  EEK!  I thought if I had to clean up the whole 3 bedroom house with a loft and a kitchen that had floor that was stained by wine during a party that happened when I was on vacation, I was absolutely not going to clean another room.  So, I called the professionals and I'm glad I did!  \n\nIt was easy to get an estimate so they will schedule it out for you.  They thoroughly walk you through what you want done such as inside the cabinets, floor boards, ceiling fan, blinds, sanitization, etc.  Thereafter you make the decision to continue with the cleaning by giving them a call and scheduling a date and time.  \n\nOn the day of the cleaning they came on-time as scheduled and 2 female professional cleaners came.  Ramona and Andrea did the job in less than 2 hours!  They also touched up the half bathroom as an added bonus.  \n\nIf you grew up in a very clean household and had the luxury of having an immaculate house to come home to and now you need to clean up after someone who does not appreciate the art of cleanliness then call Merry Maids!  They have the right equipment and highly trained to get the job done fast.  \n\nNow I'm enjoying the spotless 2nd Master Bedroom and I can finally utilize it as a guest room.  It cost $135 to get a filthy master bedroom, full bath with glass doors and a half-bath touched up and it was worth EVERY PENNY!  I had the roommate reimburse me the money of course...
