I miss the happy hour pizza. Other than that and the atrocious bathrooms, this place is pretty much unchanged. They used to have the worst bathroom ever. The only bathroom I have ever been in that was worse was in Edinburgh Scotland. When you walked into the bathroom it was a tile floor with a drain. You slowly realize that you are standing in the toilet.\nI enjoy all of the carved up wood. Like cave drawings from a long lost culture.
