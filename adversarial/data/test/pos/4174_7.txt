Everytime Im in Vegas I stop by this buffet, but I noticed its always a hit or miss when it comes to the crab legs. There are times when the crab legs are humongous and tasty and once in a while its skinny messy. But when they are on point I would definitely rate this a 5 star. Oysters are always low quality and not shucked well most of the time that has shells in the oysters. Since buffet price is $60 wish they at least get some high quality oysters.
