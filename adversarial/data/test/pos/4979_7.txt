I'm gonna keep this review short ---- actually this is my experience and I'll give you all an insight on how I got to 2 stars.\n\nAfter leaving Sport Clips with my pseudo-wannabe hipster haircut, I saw a sign that said 90% OFF EVERYTHING AT BOARDERS! By some random guy in the street.  So I did what any rational human being would do, I decided it was the perfect time to get a shitload of books no one has ever heard about at some obscure price you wouldn't know about.\n\nSo far, 5 Stars.\n\nI walk into Boarders, the signs in the store say 70-90% off everything, I was promised 90% off everything!  Boy oh howdy, people who follow my Xanga Web Vlog know how furious I was to figure out that Boarders gave me the good'ole \"rope-a-dope\".\n\nLoses 1 Star\n\nI checked out their book selection, pretty decent considering that everything was about 80% off on average and I was kind of surprised that everything wasn't sold out.\n\nThen, I saw a very beautiful oriental woman just walking around, looking at random books and my first thought was, \"bink\".  My second thought was, \"Hey I'll talk to her\".\n\nThen I pondered on whether or not I should spend time and effort on going after her, after about 2 minutes I figured, \"sure\".  Little did I know while I was pondering, she vanished.\n\nLoses 1 Star.\n\nWell eff that noise, I grabbed a few books that looked decent and worked my wait up to the cashier.  She was in her 60's or something, and since I was in a cheery mood I decided to bust out the small talk.\n\nJoey: Howdy!\nCashier: ...\nJoey: Oh boy gettin some cheap books today, good stuff right?\nCashier: ...\nJoey: ...\nCashier: $15.31 is your total.\n*I pay with debit card*\n*Cashier hands it back, doesn't say anything*\nJoey: Well you have a good weekend *takes one step away*\n*Cashier says nothing*\nJoey: *turns back and finger guns her way* LIKEWISE! :D\n\nLoses 1 star and a potential friend that never warmed up to me.\n\nI hope a dog humps her leg for 12 minutes then bites her pinky toe. \n\nSo yeah, shitty borders, It would be 1 star but everything was dirt cheap.
