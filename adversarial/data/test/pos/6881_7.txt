I like the concept of being able to add the different proteins in my pho.  It's my ultimate when I get to customize my dish.  Though they don't have tripe, the quality of meat and super hot broth is just perfect.  The location is great and the price is just right.\n\nThe customer service is spot on, professional and their uniforms makes this casual place a desirable place to dine in.  I thought the amount of meat to noodles were a decent amount.  I got 3 different type of flank meat to meatballs just to get a nice variety. \n\nAnother great addition to Henderson without having to travel to Chinatown to get a good bowl of pho. The owner left the east coast to settle here and it looks like it'll do good.
