I LOVE DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS, so many BEST KEPT SECRETS & The Griffin does not disappoint. I went here because one of my friends were spinning a set at the Griffon so I decided to check it out. Its secret-ness look from the outside made the place seem more underground I love it!\n\nThe Walk through\/ front door: Total mind trick I swear, in front of The Griffin is a bouncer, this bouncer reminds me of those old movies where you tell the door man a secret password so he lets you in. \n\nFirst room: When you first walk in (I went on a Saturday) The first room (I did not know their were 2 rooms) was a narrow lounging room filler with hipsters and frat college guys. The music was not what I thought it would be kind of mellow but not EDM (dance music which was what my friend was spinning)\n\nSecond room: so I decided to keep walking to the back of the Griffon and OMG to my surprise. There was a second room and this room was where the party was at. I swear the rooms must be sound proofed because the second room was loud and packed with EDM hipsters jamming. I loved every second. Only bad thing the place was crazy packed.
