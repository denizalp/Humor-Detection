Let me tell you. I have been a huge fan of ATL Wings ever since I found them in Chandler a few years ago. Had some friends coming into town who used to go to the Chandler location with me and they had been craving wings and asked if I could pick up some for Super Bowl Sunday, I said heck yea, but since I wasn't going to be close to Chandler, let's try the Phoenix location, so that's what we did! \n\nWhat was ordered\" 12 piece Garlic Parmesan, 12 piece Cajun BBQ and 12 piece Honey Habanero \n\nEach wing was cooked to perfection and coated perfectly, these are some great wings, my favorite still is the honey habanero though Oh wee! So good!\n\nIf you haven't tried ATL, you need too! Go! Now! Get some wings!
