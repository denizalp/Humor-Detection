I grew up in this neighborhood but didn't really discover Uncky Sam's until I was ready to go away to college 35 years ago. I'm 85 years old and my taste buds have over the years been replaced with the desire for the youth I once took for granted. But if there's one culinary recollection that brings a little flutter to this old man's heart it's the phantom taste of a Cheese Hoagie, that phallic masterpiece of untold proportions from Uncle Sam's.\n \nIt's huge. \n\nThey don't let me drive anymore but once in a while I want to jump in a cab and order one for old time's sake with with an extra side of the hoagie dressing. And eat it over the course of six days. It's that good. And that big. The hoagies are cold. The grinders are hot. The ingredients are slightly different for each but good god is this place good. The fountain drinks taste like they are mixed with really gross water but I gladly put up with it because the sandwiches are soooooo good. I've never really ordered anything else and can't speak to the rest of their menu but if you want a really really really good sub try Uncle Sam's.
