Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things  at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? \n\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all.
