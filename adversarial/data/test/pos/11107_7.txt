When I choose this company, I wish I had read a one star review! I paid almost 1,000$ for a local move and they damaged items (feet broke off dresser, hole in box spring, etc...) and they left some items disassembled (a shoe rack was left in clear wrap and lamp pieces were missing).... they were rough with my items, piling 3 heavy boxes on a dolly and taking down a flight of stairs. One of the boxes split open. \nI am thinking the problem stems from the way they employee their workers. It sounded like they are independent contractors, not actual employees of the company. \n\nThey can correct me if I am wrong, but one of the workers almost explicitly said that they get paid \"by the job\" and not by the hour...when I asked why they \"rushed through and damaged my items\". I'm actually so appalled I did not contact the company nor will I.
