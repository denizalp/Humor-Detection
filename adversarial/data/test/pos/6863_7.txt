Costco is awesome. (Enough said!)\n\nThis Costco has the usual large parking lot that is almost always full of cars. It is a rare day that a parking spot opens up near the entrance and you just happen to be right there, ready to park.\n\nIf you've never been in a Costco, they are all about the same. Sometimes the entry is on the right, sometimes it's on the left.\n\nCostco has a good selection of seasonal merchandise. Just be aware that when they run out you'll have to wait until next year if you missed out.
