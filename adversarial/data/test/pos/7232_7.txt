I was expecting an authentic indonesian restaurant in madison. reason is that there are many indonesian student in Madison. but apparently, not.\ndon't get me wrong, it is not bad, because the food is now tailored to american taste. I'm kinda surprise to see soo many people in the restaurant, and I'm the only non white.\nI ordered empek2, sayur lodeh, tahu and some other items.\nthe food don't even look right (close), but it don't taste even close to what it supposed to be.\nif you think you've taste indonesian food and you think that place taste good. wait till you taste the real good one. it will blow your sock off.\n\ngood place to get to know indonesian food. but for people who are looking for good indonesian food, not here.
