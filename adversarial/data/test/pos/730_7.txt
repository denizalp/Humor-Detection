OMG!!!! If I could give this place a negative 12 stars, I would!I took some parts in to be re-chromed. After 4 trips over there, a long way from my house, and a complete run-around, they still hadn't finished the work on my parts and it had been over two months! Who gives a crap how good or bad their work is, when it takes that long, or longer, to get them to finish your stuff! Complete waste of time, and I finally went over and demanded they return my items on the spot, which they did. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
