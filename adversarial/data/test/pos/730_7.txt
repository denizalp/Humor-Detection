Three words: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.\n\nIf you go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR (and you will), this item has to be one you consider trying. Now, I know the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are popular items; but listen to me: you see that photo I posted of that Southern Yardbird Burger? That could be YOU.\n\nWith that out of the way, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was enjoyable overall. My crew knew that there was going to be a wait in order to seated; we got to the restaurant around 5 on a Friday. Once we got the text message that seating was available, it was on. I can't remember exactly who our waiter was, but he was on point the entire time; made sure drinks were filled, provided great recommendations, and provided that Las Vegas hospitality to some folks coming from the East Coast.\n\nI can definitely see why this place stays packed: good food + good drinks + good service + friendly atmosphere = satisfied and returning customers. I will be back here once I come back to LV.\n\nOh yeah, before I forget: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.
