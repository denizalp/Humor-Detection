Superb artisan ice cream....with rocky road being my favorite. The staff is always very nice and friendly and the prices are reasonable. Sweet republic has an array of flavors to choose from and also make their own waffle cones and marshmallows. On tops of that, they have freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and a small assortment of candies.
