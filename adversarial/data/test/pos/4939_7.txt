Stellar service , world class ambiance and carefully crafted cocktails fit for royalty but priced approachable for paupers and thirty thousand dollar millionaires like myself who appreciate the finer things--thoughtfulness and attention to detail.  \n\nI came across this place a few months ago on yelp nation and last night whilst entertaining a ladyfriend unsheathed my sword to hack free from the confines of mercbar's Saturday night tomfoolery--fortune does in fact favor the bold as we were greeted immediately by the owner himself whom openly weighed the benefits of different tables available for seating.  \n\nWe decided on the second floor where we were cheerfully greeted with ice waters and a consultative approach to our dining intentions and preferences of the libation variety.  \n\nBeing somewhat of a fattard and a peanut butter prostitute I immediately was drawn to the PB and J and very happy that I ordered it.  Warm, delicious and beautifully presented peanut butter cookie dough baked to perfection with candied peanuts and jelly layers topped with PB ice creamery goodness.  A low calorie option , this is not.  Life is short and memory of this masterpiece will enjoy longevity.  \n\nSeeing we were open for suggestions our server (Jaimie ? Jake? Maybe) asked a few questions and then returned with a midway and a cucumber gimlet--which was superb while the midway was a little sweet but a good fit for aforementioned lady-friend. \n\nOur server had a hobbit likeability and was attentive and funny without being annoying.  Had a nice sense of self mockery and mirrored our moods perfectly.  I hope he has a meteoric rise per Frodo Baggins. \n\nWe closed the place down but never felt the slightest bit rushed.  \n\nThis place is in fact a perfect ten! Well done, well played and we'll be back.
