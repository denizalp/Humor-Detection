This is the best lunch deal in Las Vegas by far! The restaurant is beautiful,  modern, airy, and elegant. We were greeted with a friendly smile by the host and seated at a comfortable booth with an awesome view.\n\nWe decided on the $25 prix fix lunch, as we had heard so many good things about it. I started with the tomato salad. It was delicious.  The tomatoes are so fresh and juicy and comes with feta cheese and is dressed with greek herbs and extra virgin olive oil. My boy friend got the grilled octopus  (extra $10) and was worth it. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I splurged and got the lobster and pasta (extra $15). I highly recommend it for it was delicious.  The lobster was sweet and full of flavor and the pasta was cooked al dente, perfectly, the way I love it! My boyfriend had the Mediterranean Sea bass..again perfectly cooked and seasoned.  For dessert we shared the Greek yogurt and fresh berries and the walnut cake with honey. All I can say is YUM!\n\nEverthing served here is fresh. They have a beautiful produce and fish display. (See pictures ) I love that they have healthy choices! The restaurant is clean and spacious.The staff is attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Vegas.
