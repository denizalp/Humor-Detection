PHX is massive. Good luck if you have a short layover and need to get to a different terminal is less than 45 minutes. These terminals are HUGE and individual airports in their own right. \n\nTerminal 4 tends to be the go-to BFL to PHX and back Terminal, so I'm most familiar with this guy. It's easy, clean, convenient. \n\nThere is always someone around to ask questions (just look for the purple jacket\/vest folks!)\n\nThere are people mover's that connect terminals which really help with getting somewhere quickly. I love the feeling of running on these guys - I feel like the bionic woman! \n\nOverall, PHX is pretty self-explanatory. It's much easier than LAX and infinitely more friendly!
