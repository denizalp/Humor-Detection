Just your local Portuguese butcher. One step inside and you'll be overwhelmed with the smell of fresh meat. It's a classic take-a-number, gawk at slabs of animals and pick up a pound or two kind of place. Nosso Talho has been around since the mid-seventies, and you can just tell it's a fixture of the neighbourhood. It was pretty bumpin' (as meat shops go) on the weekend, but it didn't take long to get served and all the staff were proactive and willing to help.\n\nAll meats are represented and at pretty good prices too. We picked up 10 spicy sausages for $10, and a couple of blood sausages for $5. There are plenty of additional groceries to round out your Portuguese cooking needs. Quite a few cheeses and canned goods also.\n\nI can't vouch for the quality of the cuts, but the sausages were A-OK. Fairly convenient location for west enders too. I approve.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Welcome to PORK-tugal. \n\nMenu Readability: Huge Honest Ed's-esque signage. \n\nNeed to mention: Stock up on Sumol here.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I really don't understand how to pronounce a single thing in Portuguese. What is UP with this language?
