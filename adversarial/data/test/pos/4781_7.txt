After reading all the praise on Yelp, I had to check this place out for myself. I came on a weekday afternoon and spent about 3 hours of bliss here. \n\nService: staff were all very helpful, from the reception desk area to the RMT who did my massage (Annette). They gave me a tour and explained everything before I got started. My RMT was fabulous. I would have given her a big tip, but they have a no tipping policy here. \n\nFacilities: just beautiful! The area is very calming with dim lights and high ceilings. Change rooms could be a bit more spacious (few areas or benches to put your clothes etc.) but I really liked the 'vanity' area (stools, big mirrors, good lighting, lotions, hair products, etc.). Showers -- when it's busy you may have to wait for one. There is a big open shower, but you have to be pretty immodest to use it. Also, one of the showers had really cold water for some reason. I kept fiddling with it, but no matter what the temperature stayed the same:S \n\nThe waters etc. : all treatments include the therapeutic water circuit, which is really what sets this spa apart from others. I loved the green tea pool and the sauna. The eucalyptus steam room is reeeeally hot, so I found it difficult to sit in there for more than 3 mins. The cold pool is fantastic too -- again, very extreme temperature change but invinigorating! \n\nRefreshments: aside from water, there is a tea and smoothie bar. You can order at the beginning (you pay for your service at the start) or you can pick up the phone anytime and order a drink. Someone will bring it out to you! I love that you can sip a fruity smoothie while sitting in one of the pools -- so relaxing! I had the pomegranate, blueberry, banana one ($5.50). Super-fresh and yummy!! \n\nOverall: even on a weekday, it got quite busy. It is nice alone, but you will also see lots of groups of girl friends. The steam room and sauna are deemd \"quiet zones\", but at times there was still a lot of chatter which took away from the zen atmosphere a bit. Still, I really enjoyed Body Blitz and would come again. Don't forget to bring a water bottle and a book if you want to chill on the lounge chairs for a bit after your service! \n\nNB: An east end location is opening soon!
