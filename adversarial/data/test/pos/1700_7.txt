I'll start out by saying I think I'm being generous with 2 stars. (I changed this later)\n\nI went to this gym for 2 months because my fiance at the time got 2 free months for a guest.  It feels like walking into a time share meeting when you get there for the first time.  I had a guy take me off to an office and go through what goals I wanted to achieve.  The whole time it felt like I was being treated like I could be so much more if I just worked out there which really pissed me off, but whatever, I was there for free.\n\nAnyway, they always advertise no contract which is good (if it's true), but when I asked about it, it seems like it's only for a couple months or something.  Then you have to put a bunch of cash down for the privilege of walking through their doors, and then they will let you pay the monthly fee which is also too high.\n\nWhen my wife cancelled her membership because we moved, they treated her like she was going to become a fat lazy slob.  It was really infuriating.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about the trainers (the ones that run the classes).  They are contractors and from what I understood, they're getting a bit of a crap deal too.  All of them were great and really nice.\n\nAfter thinking about this more, I'm dropping them to 1 star.  I was giving them 2 because I really liked the trainers, but they're contractors anyway, and it seems like World Health is giving them a crap deal when I spoke with a couple of them.\n\nPros:\n\nDecent equipment\nGreat trainers\nGood classes\nTowels\n\nCons:\n\nSurrounded by d-bags (Its like walking into Melrose bar sometimes.)\nNot a good environment to get back into shape if you're self conscious\nRIP OFF.  The contracts (even if that's the way most gyms work) are a total rip off.\nArrogant staff\nFeels like you're being herded through like cattle\nHave fun quitting
