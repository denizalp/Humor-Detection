This was a firist experience renting an RV for a trip to the Grand Canyon. We rented a 30ft RV for the trip. The customer service at this location isn't the best. There was an hour wait just to pick up the RV. The RV itself was clean and roomy. You can't run the cabin AC , use the microwave and electrical outlets without running generator. Room to sleep eight people,  fridge, freezer, stove top.
