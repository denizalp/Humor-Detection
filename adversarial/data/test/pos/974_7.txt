My fianc√© and I just stayed here this weekend. The first night was great, the beds are pretty comfy and the room was a good size. The second night, however, we had some unruly neighbors that decided to have no respect for anyone around them and kept us up all night. The staff is a big reason why I'm giving all 5 stars, because of how understanding they were and accommodating they were. It's hard to come by staff who actually care about your stay, and they do that here. The breakfast wasn't the anything to roar about, but it's complimentary so you can't complain. Overall it was a good experience and next time we make the trip from San Diego to Goodyear it will be a good hotel choice.
