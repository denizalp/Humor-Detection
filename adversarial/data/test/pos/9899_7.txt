Warning: if you are a party of 7 or more, you are forced to order their tasting menu (served family style) at $20+ something a person. Um, what if your entire party just wants Hainan chicken?! Such crap. \n\nSo, our party of 7 split up to groups of 4 and 3 and ordered what we wanted. The server didn't seem happy about it and her face showed her frustration when we decided to separate. We called her out on it. She was shocked, but was all smiles the rest of our stay. \n\nThe Hainan chicken is probably the best in the city, and is comparable to Savoy in LA (but not quite there).
