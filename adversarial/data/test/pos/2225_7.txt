Customer service was good.  \nSleek styled unisex glasses.  \nGreat leather shoes, especially the flats.  \nLeather handbags are reasonably priced and bear unique colors.\n\nDeductions:\n1) Overpriced nylon bags\n2) Get rid of the upside down triangle logo already!!!\n3) UGH!!!  The return policy is store credit ONLY, that's no good for someone with MAJOR buyer's remorse!
