Who: Cornish Pasty Co. \n\nWhat: Chicken Alfredo Pasty (Me) - Quite yummy, just a tad salty; Greek Chicken Pasty (Friend) - Pleasant, needed a bit more chicken; 2 Newcastle pints (tap) and 1 iced tea.\n\n\nWhen: Friday night - early enough to grab the last table in the joint. Come 8:30, it was getting crowded. Good vibe.\n\nWhere: In a yucky strip mall. Like nearly everything else in this state.\n\nWhy: Because we're tired of the same old crappy take-out options. Because we wanted something fresh. Because it got good reviews on this site. Because it's an independent food joint with a bit of authentic culture to boot. (They've got Pavlova and Banoffee Pie! Holy effin-A!)\n\nHow: awesome was it? Quite. Nice atmosphere, see all positives noted in other reviews. Little things detracted from a five-star giving. However, I will be back. And not for a meaty pasty next time. For one of their delish-sounding desserts. Check out the menu at their website. Yuh-hum!
