Horrible!!! This is no way to treat veterans! The doctor that attended to me was so unprofessional he kept saying \"do you know what I'm sayin?\" too much slang! I felt like I was talking to some one on the street. It's was so uncomfortable I wouldn't even talk to my friends like that I not want my doctor that is supposed to be educated to speak to me like he's in the hood.
