Me Gusta has burritos and tacos headlining their menu but what separates these items from the others is their quality ingredients. I sampled four of the proteins for lunch and they were all fresh and flavorful. You'll pay a little extra here, but that's where your money is going. I'm a fan and I still haven't tried any of the breakfast (served all day) and \"other\" items, such as the the breakfast burritos, me gusta bowl, or stacked tater tots.\n\nFor the shortest walk, if you feel like you're going to melt in the heat, park in the lot of the District that is closest to Lucille's and Panera and walk north on the alley in front of Lucille's. We came at three o'clock on a Thursday to a clean, open, simply decorated restaurant with no other customers. The employee at the register was very courteous and helpful offering some nice suggestions. During our meal, two gentlemen, who I believe were the owners came in to do some work, but they took the time to greet us and inquire how our meal was while lowering the blinds over the front window to block the sun from blinding us.\n\nMy favorite item was the Korean kalbi taco on a flour tortilla. The meat was seasoned well while still being able to taste the marinade, with Asian cabbage slaw providing a nice crunch. If you would like a salsa, you can pick it out of the cooler. Don't be afraid of the habanero if you like spice, which they rate 9\/10. Although it did have a kick, it didn't phase me.\n\nI'm ok with the $21 lunch for two. Breakfast with churros for dessert is on the agenda for the next trip. If you're in the District and in the mood for some Mexican, Me Gusta Tacos is definitely worth a stop.
