This is my gym because I have an LA Fitness membership and it's the nearest location to my house. I'm locked into a deal where I pay only 99 bucks a year for life, so I can't really ditch it since most people pay much more than this. I don't really go that much though. This place is almost impossible to go to between 5 and 9pm... that is if it's a workout you're looking for. \n\nWhat else would you go here for? Well, this particular location is a notorious meat market - a den of hot sweatty sex where everyone's beautiful and fit. Well, not everyone - but this place is full of pretty people... pretty people who don't really look like they need to be there. Even I've been given phone numbers following conversations with pretty girls and I didn't even ask for them - it was strangely easy... too easy. It makes me kinda wonder how clean these people are - which brings me to the reason why only 3 stars...\n\nThis place is kinda gross... few people actually wipe the equpment after they use it and I don't know how often the staff wipes the machines down with antibacterial. I also don't know where everyone's asses have been. \n\nThis location is relatively new and a decent size - there's an upstairs with treadmills, climbers and elipticals - plenty of old crappy televisions to watch while you work out. Downstairs they have a few racketball courts, a full-size basketball court, a lap pool, a spin class, a day care room, freeweights, and target machines. Television programming is just local channels and the music selection they pump through the gym speakers is I think a looping tape - seems like the same songs over and over... not very good music either - bring an ipod. \n\nIt was all somewhat state of the art-ish when the place opened, but now it's starting to look a bit shabby... they don't do any maintanence on the machines unless someone complains. This place is very thrifty and cheap considering how much membership money they get. What's really missing here is towels - they should really provide towels for free - you can buy a shitty cheap shop towel for a buck, but that's just insulting. Just give everyone a towel when they enter - have a laundry bin for when they leave. People who come here probably make enough money that they don't need to steal shitty gym towels.\n\nI live so close, I don't shower here - but the bathroom area (men's anyway) seems to be kept pretty clean... although everything is always wet... always. Like a big fucking shaggy dog just got out of the pool and ran into the bathroom to shake himself dry. Plus, 80% of the time when I go in there to wash strange ass sweat off my hands, there's some old fat dude walking around naked flashing his junk. C'mon dude, just wrap a towel around yourself. \n\nThe manager at this location is a bit of an asshole as well... overall though, the staff is fine if you don't have any reason to talk to them.
