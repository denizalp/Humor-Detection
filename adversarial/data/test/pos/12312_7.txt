I remember when they first opened years ago and I liked this place. They've expanded and remodeled the place. Along with that was a decline in the quality of their food. My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies. \n\nPizza:\nWhat the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2\/5\n\nRainbow Cookies:\nWhen I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1\/5
