Another day, another two-star rating on a recommendation from my GF. I'm beginning to see a pattern LOL...\n\nFour years ago I didn't like Smashburger. Last night I didn't like Smashburger. I got the Jalapeno Baja Burger (I think that's what it's called...) I'm not sure what it is about this place that I just don't like. The burgers aren't terrible but I feel like they have no....zing (?) to them. I kinda-sorta enjoyed my burger last night but only because I smothered it in ketchup and mustard. I feel as though a burger that has fresh jalapenos, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, and some kind of chipotle sauce should pack a little more flavor and it just didn't.\n\nOther than the food, the staff was good - friendly, patient. \n\nThe one thing I would come back for though is a shake. OMG they're so good. They have the usual flavors, plus Nutter Butter, PB & J, and Butterfinger. Also, this place sells alcohol.
