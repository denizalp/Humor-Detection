Charlie's can be so tragic, but it's never dull. It's filthy, and in dire need of some updating. the sound system makes up for it though.. I just wish the music was a dash more cutting edge. The best way to sum up Charlie's = The Wal-Mart of gay bars. It's got freaks, weirdos, scary mofos, and then normal people, and all sorts of everything else. There's truly something for everyone at Charlie's, as long as you can get past some of the barfy elements.
