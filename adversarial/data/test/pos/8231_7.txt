Finally got a chance to try this popular sushi place today and I'm so glad I did!\n\nService is fast, friendly, and the best part is the food quality, really good sushi and food options!\n\nDinner choices come with miso soup and salad, a small congee, and a small ice cream scoop after the meal for free which is a nice touch!\n\nI got the fried rice with chicken ($10.95) and my fiance got the Sashimi dinner ($16.95).\n\nFried rice with chicken - very tasty and a good serving size. I am impressed by how tasty and non-greasy this dish is and I like the ratio of the rice with the chicken, there is a great amount of chicken, which is really good.\n\nSashimi dinner was great too, flavorful and nice big sushi sizes.\n\nOver-all I would recommend going to this place, as they serve good sushi. Would definitely come back, possibly to try their lunch specials.\n\nReview 83 of 100
