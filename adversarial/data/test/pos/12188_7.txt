One: this restaurant is already had a bonus playing in its favor for being in the Downtown Arts District. \nTwo: amazing f*%$in' food. \nAt the recommendation of my work buddy, I reached out to the restaurant for information to host a wedding rehearsal dinner. Got a quick response from Owner\/Chef James Trees, quoting us around $40\/person for a family style meal that has about 7-9 items on their back patio. He also quoted $36-$40 wine bottles during the meal. Getting this message seriously bursts stars in the air for me. LOL. How many chefs\/owners do y'all know that are this proactive in responding to prospective guests\/patrons? That's what I'd call dedication and love. Whatever you think of the situation, I was already creating my argument to let my fiance know this is where our dinner should be at. Long story short: my fiance gave on the stipulation that we actually eat there first. Fair deal, so I make reservations for Saturday night through their website, which is actually done through Open Table. \nGetting there, we had to hunt for the entrance 'cause Siri led us to the side of the building complex. There's no hanging signage like its neighboring establishment, so walk out to look for etched window signage for the restaurant. There's also front patio seating, which seats about 2 people comfortably per table from what I remember. The back patio is fenced off from the sidewalk and looks like you could seat at least 30-35 people comfortably. \nWalking in, we're nicely greeted by a hostess that quickly asked if we had reservations. No biggie there 'cause the restaurant was already packed around 6pm dinner service. Seating arrangements make it feel like California restaurants where they seat as many as possible with easily movable tables. Servers are smart about when to bring up your courses because of the amount of table space (limited for 2 people) XD\nI thought I remembered our server introducing himself as Mike, but it was pretty loud, and the check said Micah. Friendly guy that made sure we were good throughout the entire meal! Alright, now to drinks and food...\nClassic cocktails are made as they should be: strong and with a distinct flavor profile. My fiance and I got a Dark & Stormy (classic tiki) and Old Fashioned. Pretty good start to the meal, especially with the Housemade Sourdough Bread and Burrata Alla Panna (think of it as a kinda mozzarella). Hella awesome is what it was! For our main course, it was the Rigatoni Carbonara and Cavatelli. Can't go wrong with a Carbonara, but if you want someone to eat their veggies with a small kick of spice, order the damn Cavatelli! For dessert, I got the Budino which was pretty much butterscotch with salt. Yes...! A balanced sweet and salty creation I would want at the start or end of any meal. \nAlright, so pricing is what'd you expect of any Downtown restaurant. For the 2 of us, we spent around $77 (excludes gratuity) for 2 cocktails, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas treated as a main course, and 1 dessert. \nWill be back? Most definitely. I'd count it as one of the great Downtown restaurants.
