If you like DUIs or like people driving out on the street wasted without being cut off by a bartender then this is the place for you!!!! They will serve you to the point that you can barely walk and then watch you drive off into the sunset. But dont worry the customer service doesnt end there ~ Your bartender will even send you a cute little text message (because she knows you are beyond wasted) just to make sure you got home okay.... LOL if you have to send a customer a text message to make sure they got home okay then uummmmmmm hint maybe you shouldnt have served them so much and just maybe hopefully the liquor board will investigate this shaddy bar. I use to bartend and in no way shape of form should anyone be allowed to drink as much as this bar does without cutting them off!!!! This bar is a danger to our roads...
