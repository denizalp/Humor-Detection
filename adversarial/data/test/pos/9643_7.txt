I love the pizza here! After living in Arizona for the past few years, I've tried a variety of different places in addition to the standard chains of Pizza Hut\/Domino's and I have to say nothing really compares to Stevie's! I love that they make a good, simple, delicious New York style pizza for an affordable price. They have the perfect balance of crust\/cheese\/sauce and every slice is delicious as the last. Everyone that I've had try their pizza has been converted into a fan. I'm definitely going to miss this pizza when I move back home. I hope they stay in business forever so I can come back every time I visit AZ!
