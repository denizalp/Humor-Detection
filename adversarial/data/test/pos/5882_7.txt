Once again, I'm reminded of a place I visited and that I enjoyed, but allowed to drop off my food radar.  I guess for a while I traveled so much last year that it's not too hard to imagine I'd forget about a few places.\n\nI remember my first 2 stops in to the brick and mortar of what used to be Trucking Good Food.  I really did enjoy the food.  Almost a year since my last visit and today was no different.\n\nI stopped in today for a lunch, solo.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken savory crêpe and I also ordered the Sugar\/Brûléed Crêpe just to have a taste.  The Buffalo chicken crêpe http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#gouRfEaEXqFqRmQbKNUsOw was sided with a shaved pickled carrot mixture.  I don't eat a lot of \"bready\" foods, but by gholly, this is one dish that I can just dig into.  The buffalo-blue cheese sauce was delicious.  Not as spicy as I like, but still good and definitely not to salty as some sauces like this can be.  The sauce was not in a quantity to make the dish messy and hide the texture of the crêpe.  The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.  I loved it.  it would have been nice to have some fresh bleu cheese with it though.  \n\nI should have gotten something on my sweet crêpe.  I thought the Sugar Crêpe would  be a little sweeter.  Still, it was delicious for a small taste of something sweet after lunch with a cup of coffee.   http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#MY2V3YAlEVwkb5yXIhCfgw\n\nI discovered that the Crêpe bar now carries Hayden Flour Mills products.  The fact that this company is attempting to bring back native grains to AZ is a great story.  If you're not familiar, check it out.  http:\/\/www.haydenflourmills.com\/  You can buy some of their products at CB now.  \n\nMy last review still stands!!!!  Where are the duck fat fries?  I did ask about the, but it looks like there is no plan to bring them back.  I have to monitor Facebook and Twitter to find out if they are on special.  which pretty much means, I probably won't have theirs again.  *sad face*
