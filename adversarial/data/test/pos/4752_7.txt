Terrible office manager. \n\nI missed an appointment (come on we all do it time to time). I had purchased on a groupon and I was told it would be voided. \n\nBeing new to the area I was looking for a new dentist. These groupons are not done to make money but bring in new patients. I explained it would be in their best interest to just honor the groupon and I'd be a new patient. \n\nThey opted for just canceling and sending me on my way. The doctor should educate his staff on good patient relations.
