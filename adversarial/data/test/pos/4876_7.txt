I don't plan on coming back as they don't have AYCE option, yet their sushi is very much AYCE quality. I can understand places like Miko's not having AYCE because their menu is extensive and fish consistently fresh. The nigiri at this place was just mush, the rolls we had kept falling apart and the prices were on the higher side.\n\nWhen we first walked in, the restaurant was empty. I noticed the decor was very lovely and modern and I had high hopes that we had found a nice go to sushi joint near the house. As we are sitting down, my butt has not even touched the seat, much less looked at the drink menu the server asks what would we like to drink. \"Uhhh...guess I'll start with water \" is all I could say. I then ask if they have AYCE..she almost scoffs and says no. I think to myself, either this will be some bomb ass sushi or this woman is a delusional witch. It turned out to be the latter. As we are looking through the menu in the span of FIVE minutes she comes by at least 3 times asking if we had decided, increasingly annoyed each time. NO PRESSURE. Eventually we opt for baked mussels (pretty good), nigiri sampler (eight pcs of mushy old fish for $19.99)..oh that comes with a miso soup which I imagine salty bath water would taste like. Ex girlfriend roll ($14.95 and fell apart) and Tiger roll ($12.95..confusing... 5 of the 8 pcs had salmon on top, one pc had half salmon half nothing and the remaining two had \"white tuna\"). It took forever to get our last roll.... we were checked on once where a different server asked if I'd like my water refilled. At least we got the check and got out of there as quickly as possible. $60 down the drain. I think this place gets rave reviews because a) this is hendertucky and b)there are no other sushi joints in the vicinity. \n\nPoor service, poor quality of fish, no AYCE, and stupid prices.
