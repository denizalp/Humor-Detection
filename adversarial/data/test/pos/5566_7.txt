Where do I even start? This place sucks ass! We sat down at the table and one of us ordered the Philly Cheesesteak.  The waitress says, \"If you want onions or mushrooms, it's an extra .35 each\"  WTF!!!!! A Philly cheesesteak sandwich is supposed to come with onions and mushrooms!   We ordered a large pizza, okay? Not some greesy dough covered in slimy, greasy cheese.  HORRIBLE! \nThen here's the kicker.  The waitress comes out with four glasses and four BOTTLED WATERS!  \"Hold up,\" I say, \"I didn't order bottled water...regular water is fine.\"  She says, \"Water is a dollar a bottle...it all goes to charity.\"  WTF????  \"Well, you really should have told us that when we asked for water,\" I replied.  The waitress just looked at me and said, \"Do you want the waters or not?!\"  \nOh HELL to the F*** no, you didn't, Bimbo. \nThe next time she came out to our table and asked if there was anything else she could get for us, I just said, \"Just more napkins...UNLESS...you charge for those too!\"\nAbsolutely, hands down, the WORST restaurant in the Miracle Mile!
