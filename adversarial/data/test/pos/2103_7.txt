The food here was pretty good! Came here for lunch and was able to get a table right away.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and modern.  There was a whole page of lunch specials, all rice dishes.  Each meal comes with hot tea, soup (wonton or hot & sour), and small bowl of rice for $10-12.  The service was quick and friendly.  They brought out hot tea as soon as we sat down.  My friend ordered the Hunan Beef and that dish came out right away like it was already ready.\n\nI ordered the Szechuan Fish lunch special $10 and it was delicious!  The fish was nicely breaded and covered in a red sauce.  As a matter of fact, as I looked around, all the meals seem to have the same red coloring\/sauce.  I wish there was just a little more rice, but that's just me.\n\nThey have noodle dishes, but they are not part of the lunch special.
