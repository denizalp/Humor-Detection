The tickets are inexpensive but the taxi ride to and from the Strip (Mandalay Bay) is going to cost about $35 each way.  You also need to reserve in advance as they get sold out.\n\nThe tour lasts about an hour and you can take pics along the way. It was OK. Not all that exciting. Maybe the night tour is nicer because I think they light up the signs.
