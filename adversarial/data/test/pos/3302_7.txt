Chase is an affordable, family friendly, squeaky clean ballpark in the heart of Phoenix. I was excited to get fantastic seats for under $40 on Labor Day, when my Giants were defeated by the Diamondbacks, and when Arizona Native Tartar Sauce aka The Great Grumpy Cat, decided to grace us with her presence and \"throw out\" the first pitch (\"I get you girls amazing seats and you get the most excited OVER A CAT.\" -The Long-Suffering Dbacks Fan, Host, Chauffeur, and BF of the BFF. Totes not true. ;-D). There is no such thing as amazing seats for that price at my park. Me, one of my besties, and her boyfriend came early so I could wander around the ballpark and take it all in. I got to see a bit of the early practice, though we arrived after batting practice, respectively. It was fun to wave at the team and sit in the visiting section with all my other orange friends. The only reason I took a star off is for the not so awesome acoustics and sound in this building. It is massive, and has A\/C, which is awesome during a typical Phoenix day, but it was hard to hear.\n\nThere are so many things to do here, and so many things to EAT. Two words: Churro. Dog. Donut\/Ã‰clair bun, churro in the middle, covered with ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and nuts. Yes and please! My diet starts tomorrow!\n\nI appreciated the variety of food, not that I needed any after having the aforementioned sinful sugarbomb. My bestie and I split a red rope and had a few drinks. That was plenty. It was set up a lot like a huge food court in here. There were lots of chain kiosks like Subway, ColdStone, and Panda Express, along with the usual themed ballpark food, like pizza and hot dogs of all kinds, including the Sonoran Dog, which is also supposed to be famous and delicious.\n\nJack Daniel's Mixed Drink booth was another favorite. Chase doesn't skimp on hard alcohol availability. This was just one choice among many as far as mixed drinks went.There are beer choices, but you have to hunt for them. Tall cans were available, which was nice.\n\nPricing as a whole is a lot cheaper than SF, and even Oakland, the only other two places I've been to a Major League Ballgame. Not only that, but they offer family meal deals, cheap deals on food as low as $1.50, AND they have All You Can Eat Seats here. WHAT. There is a whole section where you can gorge yourself while you watch. \n\nAs if this isn't enough to choose from, there's also a swimming pool in right field, which is either a very good or very terrible idea. Sounds like a good way to distract people who are bored by baseball, but also a good way to get beaned with a homer. \n\nAll in all, Chase is a blast. I appreciated the smorgasbord of the senses. Don't forget to take a look at the Rube Goldberg machine outside!
