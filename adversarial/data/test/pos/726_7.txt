Lisa is awful. Rude, unorganized, incompetent - just downright unpleasant. Here is a rundown of our night:\n\n1. Arrive to find out we cannot bring our own wine. To know this beforehand, we would have needed to call her directly and ask or go to FAQ page of the CORPORATE website. \n\n2. A glass of wine is $9 . But you get to keep the glass! But then the refills are still $9... ooookay.\n\n3. sit down, look at the canvas and realiza the ENTIRE PAINTING HAS ALREADY BEEN SKETCHED OUT. I kid you not, this location sketches every single \"painting\" prior to the customers painting them... this is a paint by number event, NOT the normal wine and canvas experience, where you start with a blank canvas and TRULY create your own version of the painting. There is NO WAY to cover some of these pencile marks, as areas of the canvas are painted with light colors. You have no choice - and the sketches are NOT that great, so you are stuck with the lazy-eyed, off center piece of canvas you sit in front of. Fantastic. \n\n4. The \"teacher\" stood at the front and painted the first TWO steps with us. She never went back to the main canvas, never showed us anything else. NOT ONE THING. there was NO direction at all. No \"this is how you do it\"... even when my sister asked Lisa how to do certain things, she just looked at her and said: \"you just do it with your brush\".  No way? Really? All five people in my party were floored by the complete lack of instruction and Lisa's unwillingness to help.\n\n5. When trying to speak to\/get the attention of one of the women in my party, Lisa wasn't close enough to her so she yelped out (and I kid you not): \n\"Hey, you, Hey PERSON\" \nI could not make this up if I tried. It is THAT insane.\n\n6. she insisted that we use very specific colors. Ex: \"That part is green, you need to make it green\".... ummmmmmmmmm, NO. I can make that part purple if I damn well please. Except for you can't, because you are not allowed to have any color of paint that she has not approved and put on your plate for you. I understand she is trying to be frugal - but come on! \n\n7. If you swear, she will yell at you. I am not joking. She literally scolded SEVERAL grown adults for swearing. To the point where she rang a bell a couple of times! After calling one of my friends \"person\" and being continously rude to my sister, I was very upset... THEN she put her finger on my canvas, and her nail caught and drug wet paint out of the area it should have been in (dark green) , I was just DONE. I said: \"That was your \"F-ing\" fingernail that did that!\" ... she stopped, refused to move, and stared at me in silence for a solid 30 seconds before moving on and telling me what I NEEDED to do. From that point, she ignored me completely - refused to offer me anymore paint, so I had to ask people around me to use theirs since I was in \"time out\". (Don't worry, two others were put in time out as well - I was not alone)\n\n8. At the end, she offered to take a picture of the other group of people who were there (people who were also not too thrilled with her, but had refrained from saying anything about it). Then, after they left, she went behind her little wall and stood there until we left. She did not say good-bye, she did not apologize for her behavior, NOTHING. We literally were alone in the studio area for a solid 10 minutes, and she just hid behind a small wall and refused to come out until we left.\n\n9. I could have meditate to the slow music she had on the entire time. NOT ideal for a night out! \n\nWe have been to a lot of these wine and canvas places - it is something I enjoy. And every time I go, my group has a ton of fun! The teachers are always amazing, outgoing, and friendly. The atmosphere is upbeat and happy. Everyone is laughing and enjoying themselves, getting to know the people around them, and creating UNIQUE, PERSONAL pieces of art. I like to bounce around to different painting places to  see what each one has to offer... and I have yet to regret going to one... UNTIL NOW. I will tel every single person I encounter about this place and how awful it is. IN fact, I will probably go out of my way to find a reason to bring it up, just so I can share with them where to NOT go. \n\nAdvice, based on my personal experiences... go to a place that is not part of a franchise.
