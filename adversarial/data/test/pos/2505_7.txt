When I walked in around 4PM, I was approached by a super rude man who acted like I was a burden for coming in to get a oil change.... Karl who was next to him immediately cut off the rude man and said he would be happy to service me... That right there is fantastic customer service. \n\n****The manager Matthew has reached out to me and apologized... He doesn't work here anymore as of 4\/2015.... Waiting for Karl to call me back*****\n\nAll their reviews are fake too. The manager makes people write 5 stars and that's all he cares about. Everyone should go to the warm springs and eastern location
