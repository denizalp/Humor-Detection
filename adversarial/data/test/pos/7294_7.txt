My first choice for a \"way-homer\" pizza.  (That's a pizza I pick up on my way home from work.) Since Floridino's is in my neck of the woods, I will call ahead before I start my commute home, order my usual (double pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage), and swing by to pick up my pipin' fresh pie.\n\nHave always been pleased with the quality of the pizza here, in particular, the crust. This pizza works best when slightly reheated in the microwave. The crust retains that perfect chew.\n\nJudging from other Yelper's reviews, I should stop by and dine-in sometime. The pasta and the pizza muffins look worth the visit.
