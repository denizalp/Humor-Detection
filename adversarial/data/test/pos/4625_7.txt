I'm not a burger person. I was skeptical about coming here... But I am a total fan. It's located in palms place where the old Simons use to be. We went on a Sunday night... It wasn't busy... But it definitely should be! \n\nWe were greeted immediately and sat a comfortable table. Our server was an amazing young man from back east. Dang, I wish I remembered his name... Probably the best service I've had out in a long time. \n\nWe ordered the pretzel as an app. Actually... My boyfriend and his friend ordered it. It was huge! A total meal\nWithin itself and definitely not vegan... But appeared to be extremely enjoyable. I ordered a glass of wine and the Virgin lettuce wraps... Holy smokes!!! They were super flavorful... Totally vegan... And absolutely delicious! Score!! My boyfriend ordered 3 pork belly sliders and fries and our friend ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Everyone loved their food. Of course... We left with left overs... But it was absolutely delicious. Will I be returning? Definitely!
