Some people follow their fav hairstylist to a new salon, we followed our fav bartender to her new bar... and we're glad we did.  \nThis place has been around since before I started driving so that's gotta be like 30 years or so but walking in, you wouldn't know it.  It's a smoking bar but is SUPER clean, the air was clear and we couldn't smell any smoke.  My wife smokes so don't think I'm bashing smokers. \nThe d√©cor was perfect for a neighborhood bar- not too many gaudy signs like Jacks or blinding neon in every corner. There were comfortable bar stools with backs around the bar and plenty of tables for larger parties.  \nThe only negative was the men's room- small and in need of an update but it was very clean.  My wife said the ladies room was very clean also.    \nThere wasn't anything going on at 8pm last night when we got there but I think either a Dj or karaoke was setting up in the back.  We had a pitcher of beer and a couple shots.  \nWe'll definitely be back.
