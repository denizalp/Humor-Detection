I really like this location, and not just because it's close to my house \nThe produce is usually in pretty condition, staff is always friendly. \nI love the Roasted Red Pepper hummus, and guacamole\/avocado dip. \nSome of my other favorite things are: Moroccan Mint Iced tea, Ahi Tuna Steak, and Carne Asada for grilling. \nI'll add to this as I remember more of my favorites.
