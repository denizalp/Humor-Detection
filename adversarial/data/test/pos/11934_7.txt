There's not much to say about this mall except it is a wounded animal, please put it out of it's misery. Many of the key shopping points have moved elsewhere for lack of bustling business. This place is barren!\n\nI have to travel to Monroeville for work at times near the mall, and the past few times I have wandered in to pick something up it's just sad. I would prefer to travel the 15miles to a better place to shop. Poor mall...I know it is an inanimate object but most of the time these places do have a heartbeat, DNR this mall is dead!!
