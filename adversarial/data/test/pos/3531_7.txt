Give me my money back !!!!!\nAfter spending $300 on two, three-course quarter size meals we were lucky enough to leave. Nothing about this restaurant is special or even worth talking about. The service is amazing but the food is very bland and the quality is lower than that of El Torito. Call me cheap but if I plan on spending $300 on a dinner with my husband it better be amazing and this place was far from that. After we left this restaurant we went back to our room to where I proceeded to eat a large king size bag of chips I bought at the airport after we landed about 3 hours prior to our dinner reservations.\nLong story short, go to El Torito, go to the food court, or find a taco cart on the strip, any of those options would be more tasty than the food they serve here .
