Why God, WHY, did you not bless me with Roger Montoya sooner??!?! Ugh. Better late than never, right?! \n\nAs anyone who reads my reviews knows, I basically have found all of my Yelp reviewed businesses off of Groupon, my go to for all things. That being said, hair cuts weren't one of them. Until now. I have been going to the same girl, for over 10 years. I wont say what salon, but its not a high end one, just a basic hair shop. However, i have stayed loyal to her, because i never had to tell her what i wanted, and we have become friends over the last decade +. Even to the extent of when i lived in LA, i held off on haircuts until i came back to Phoenix for one reason or another. \n\nSo, why go astray? Well, for one, i dont live in her area, and after a job change, felt like i needed a hair change too (us women are good for such things lol). I decided to go to Groupon to search salons in my hood, and this place popped up right away. I NEVER EVER EVER purchase a Groupon without checking Yelp reviews FIRST, they go hand in hand if you ask me. SO, as i scrolled and scrolled, through the pages of reviews, i kept seeing Rogers name come up in the reviews, and nothing but rave things were said about him. I decided to purchase the Groupon for a cut, condition and style.\n\nONE OF THE BEST CHOICES EVER!! For all wondering, yes, he does participate in the Groupon voucher (not all stylists there do). I made my appointment for 330 this afternoon, and with arriving right at 330, was surprised to be taken back a few moments later. The place is very cute, small but well laid out, it didnt feel cramped. We instantly hit it off, and had plenty of conversation in the hour i was there. He listened to my concerns, my desired style, and my fear of cheating on my long time hairdresser. \n\nAlthough young, he is very knowledgeable, having experience in both Hollywood and Phoenix. I felt comfortable with his vision for my hair, and he also explained how my current cut wasnt fit for me, and where it was choppy and not blending (side eye to my hair girl lol). I told him i wanted a change, but not a completely drastic one, my 8 year old needs to recognize me afterall! He cut about 2 inches off the length, and blended my layers in, as well as a bang trim. Which speaking of, he will do for free in between cuts so we don't botch his beautiful do. \n\nAfter telling him about my next day job fair attendance, he was even kind enough to color my roots with the spray dye, since i didnt have time to dye it prior. To me, that is above and beyond what was expected. He also gave me samples on the way out, what girl doesnt love those?!?! \n\nOverall, i am BEYOND thrilled. I may have a new gay hubby, and for sure a new stylist. Raw Raw, you have me hooked, i WILL be back.\n\nXOXO.
