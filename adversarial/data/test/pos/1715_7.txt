Donut shops on the east side are scarce, you can only find mom and pop donut shops around here.  So it's nice to see a Dunkin Donuts nearby.  I was heading to Nellis AFB and this shop is located less than 10 minutes away.  It's inside the Truck Stop up on Hollywood and is open at 5am.  \n\nI got there right when they opened and I was delighted to see that they plenty of donuts ready to order.  I got 3 dozen donuts and there were fresh from the oven.  They offered glazed, chocolate glaze, blueberry, apple, maple bars, chocolate bars, and seasonal pumpkin.  \n\nI didn't have a problem with customer service.  I chose the donuts instead of having them place random ones in, and cashier was patient with me choosing.  \n\nWould definitely come back to this location whenever I'm in the mood for Dunkin'.
