*** Review for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***\n\nN9ne has been on my radar for a long time.  I took Restaurant Week to give it a try.  \n\nThe bread basket was brought first and it had some good choices. Two pretzel rolls, two jalape√±o, cheese rolls, and a corn bread mini muffin.  Along with this was served some butter triangles with coarse salt on top.  There was also a container of spicy sauce for the rolls, too, that was very good.\n\n The first course was a choice of soups\/salads.  I opted for the Caesar salad with a cup of lobster bisque soup.  The salad was standard.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Many chunks of lobster of good size.  \n\nFor the second course, I ordered the Delmonico ribeye, a 10 ounce steak with a red wine sauce.  I ordered the steak blue.  The server confirmed that the steak would be cool inside and I agreed.  It was brought cooked a little more than blue but it was still rare and was quite good.  Along with the steak, two sides were served--a plate of asparagus spears and a container of cheddar mashed potatoes.  The steak was tender, juicy, and cooked almost perfectly.  The sides were good and generous.\n\nFor dessert, there was no choice.  It's flourless chocolate cake served with blood orange sorbet.  The cake was OK.  It was dry.  The blood orange sorbet was really good.  It made your mouth pucker.\n\nService was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking.  Even though the restaurant was not very full, sound reverberated around the room a lot and it seemed loud despite the few customers.\n\nI enjoyed my dfinner a lot and this would be a place to come back to in the future.
