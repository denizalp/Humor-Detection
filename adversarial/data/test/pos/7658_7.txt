The main thing you look for in a hotel is comfort, appeal, food options, and service. Basically, you want to feel like home with maids & great room service. I came here on a weekday, so it was not that crowded. In general, there was a lot of people but comparing the crowd from when I checked in and checked out on the weekend; it was a big difference. The lobby was very open with tons of contemporary art, flowers, and people working. As you enter the lobby, you will encounter sections where you basically check in and out, and behind it has a few restaurants. To the left, it is the casino with the lobby bars, more restaurants, and elevators to the rooms. To the right, towards the back of the lobby, will lead you outside of Aria and then face the Crystal mall. \n\nI got the deluxe room, since all the suites was booked. As you enter the room, there is a ton of closet space. There is a dresser with two closets with hangers to use and store all your luggage. I saw the other yelp reviews and photos, and admit I was scared. Yes, the furniture is old, but the rapid wear and tear from the amount of people who used it, I am not surprised. There is a \"seating section\" in the room with two comfy seats and table, it was by the window so just used this area to put makeup on. The bed had amazing down\/feather pillows, but I hated the blanket because it was too itchy. The place itself does look clean. However, I will say that they do not clean in a detailed manner, because there was dust the bottom shelf of the side table of the bed, table corners, lamps, and just certain places that's minor to detail. \n\nThe restroom is spacious with glass doors, and sliding door to the restroom. There were tons of towels, but again it has been used too much where it feels like very light sandpaper against the skin. I did try their toiletries which was basically shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, bar soaps, shower cap, q-tips, and makeup remover toiletries. The shampoo & conditioner made my hair felt like I have a lot of build up. I say walk to CVS, which is in the corner, and get what you need for the restroom. Plus, there is a bath tub inside along with the shower so overflowing wont be a problem, so get those bath bombs and enjoy a hot bath. \n\nOne of the best things that you can get by staying here is the tablet. There is a tablet next to your bed where it basically controls the room light, temperature, curtains, room service, Starbucks order, and restaurant reservations. If you are staying at the Aria, and want to go to the buffet or any restaurants at the property, then please book through the tablet because there is a separate line and even get priority to get seated. You can also order room service through the tablet. It is like having a smart home, but better because it is in a hotel! \n\nI talk to many people while staying here. When I checked in, the lady who helped me was fine but she said she will have something sent up to the room since it was a special occasion. We are still waiting. On another night, I went downstairs to ask about late check out and one of the guys told me to ask on the last night. The night before I was to check out, I was helped by a girl at the front desk who was awesome and I wish I remembered her name. She was so helpful, and even answered all my tourist questions. She did extend my check out time to noon, but I would have like it to be in the late afternoon. On Saturday morning, I called the front desk, like she told me, but the lady over the phone was just rude and said the hotel was just fully booked and hung up. Ok, so I just checked out at noon. \n\nPlease make sure that you are not charged items that is not yours. While checking out, I was charged valet and room service, the person helping me made sure it was taken out. I would stay here again because compared to the other hotels, this is more calm, spacious, cleaner, doesn't smell like cigarettes, and the tablet is amazing. However, I will want to bring my own towels and blanket, and skip on the toiletries.
