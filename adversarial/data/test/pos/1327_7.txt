For many years, a Foodland once sat here; one lousy Foodland. The owner of this Foodland also owned the one in Beechview, putting not a dime into either. He also sat on the Chamber of Commerce to prevent competition. \n\nA new day has arrived. A tyrant has been dethroned, and the age of ALDI has begun. \n\nI stopped in yesterday after putting it off for too long and will make the following observations.\n\n*I don't like everything they have, but what they do have is as good or better than any store brands I have come across. What you'll find are brands that may be unfamiliar to you (they certainly were to me). Examples include Nature's Nectar fruit drink, Belmont frozen pies, Friendly Farms sour cream, PurAqua spring water, and Boulder plastic cups. This is a strange, alternate universe indeed. \n\n*The prices are difficult to beat, their produce and paper products being particularly affordable. A titanic watermelon can be had for $3-4. Artisan lettuce costs half as much at ALDI as it does at Giant Eagle.\n\n*Their meats and cheeses are pre-packaged. No deli or meat counter can be found on the premises. \n\n*Aside from produce and meat, most of their stock comes in boxes or cans or is frozen. Remember bulk food warehouses? This is a new, cleaner, more compact version of that concept. \n\n*Their selection of pet foods and supplies is very limited. \n\n*The store is SPOTLESS.\n\nClearly, you won't find everything you need here, but if you're on a budget, and ALDI has what you need, it's worth making a trip (please...no Wal-Mart!).\n\nP.S. Honestly, this isn't the greatest supermarket in all the land, but longtime residents will tell you that this ALDI store is a marked improvement over the decrepit Rudeland of yesterday, which would have garnered -5 stars from me if it were possible.
