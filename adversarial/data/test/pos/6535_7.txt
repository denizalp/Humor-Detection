If you park in the parking garage on the third floor you can walk straight to the door! Easy, not crowded at all. That's just the beginning!\n I walked in the door and was greeted by Wendy. It's beautiful, quiet, smells nice and so peaceful. \n My massage was for 90 minutes, and I was sure she had been working on me for four hours, but it was the exact time I asked for.\n Wendy asked what was going on with me, and then she actually focused on those areas!\nShe worked on my neck, and my head felting the screws holding my neck on too tight were loosened, and floating.\n Myofascial release, aromatherapy, that one where she walks on you holding on bars, all are available to leave you completely relaxed.\n I booked online, and it was easy. Everything was perfect. Can't wait to go back.\n I have delayed two surgeries, while we see if if Wendy can't help my heal enough that I won't need them.\n You've got to go see Wendy, seriously, you owe it to yourself. You deserve it. ;)
