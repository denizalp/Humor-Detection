Today I went to the Road Kill Grill and I was shocked at no paved parking lot and no disabled parking not good. I was forced to wait in line for almost an hour to get my food, and what upset me was beer was free but not the Soda's and at a $1.00 per can that is out ragous stupid especilly for the Designated Driver's. The food after waiting in line for almost one hour was lukewarm and nothing to howel about. The seating left mutch to be desired as the table was located in the gravel and in the sun this is not good for someone who has mobility issues. If the place wishes to be called a resaraunt locate it in an Air Condishiond building with comfortable seats and servers who take your order and serve it on a real plate not in a styrafoam box and plastic utensils and most important of all Disabled parking. If you want BBQ food find a Famous Dave's they have all of the accomodations that Road Kill Grill doesn't.
