Located in a plaza, the surprisingly large interior with high ceilings feels crafty, bright, and family-friendly. We stopped by around 7:00 pm on a Sunday, hoping to get another taste of the delicious ribs and brisket I had at a recent catered event by them. Beware, the specials and popular items go quick, especially on a nice day. Since they smoke meats in limited quantities, everything I planned to order was out by the time we arrived. Bummer! \n\nBut when life hands you lemons, you channel your inner Beyonce. I went for their pulled pork and catfish entree instead, and I need to express to the Internet how amazing their catfish is. It is zero fishiness, juicy on the inside, crispy, fluffy, and salty on the outside. It didn't need the tarter sauce that came with it. Not normally a huge catfish fan, I would not hesitate to recommend this one to any fish eater, or order this one myself again. \n\nI was disappointed by their BBQ sauces though, what had been great at the event I attended, now tasted much too sweet on my pulled pork -- I'm not sure if they're working with a different recipe or what -- so I took my pork to go and it made great next-day leftovers with the TJ's BBQ sauce I had at home. \n\nTwo sides come with your entree, and I chose the mac n cheese and coleslaw. As a lover of cafeteria mac n cheese, their cheese-saucey version with large corkscrew macaroni worked great. What was crunchy fresh coleslaw at the catered event I attended tasted more like its store-bought cousin in-house, but my partner loved it. \n\nTheir key lime pie is a generous slice for $5, definitely a nice finish to a meal split between two or more people. \n\nI would love to come back, but maybe a little earlier to make sure I can get that BBQ or beer can chicken special! North and South, see you again soon.
