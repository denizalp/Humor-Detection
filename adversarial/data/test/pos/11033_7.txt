I am usually not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants. To me, most of the time this ends up being Asian dishes that are made worse rather than interesting but still delicious.\n\nSoba defies this stereotype. They have some interesting dishes but almost everything I've tried is pretty solid.\n\nMy favorite is the Miso Black Cod. The ssam jang (miso type) flavor is pervasive throughout the dish and makes the savory component complex and interesting in every bite. A slightly different take on the Nobu version, including some complements that I think elevate the dish even more. The rice cake is soft but chewy, and the black cod, the star of the dish is tender, flaky, and (dare I say it) moist. The pine nuts add a little bit of crunchy buttery and somewhat sweet taste.\n\nAnother favorite among my friends is the Rock Shrimp tempura. This is a dish that is featured in many menus, but Soba executes it so well: lightly fried and paired with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy aioli. Yum.\n\nTheir cocktails are generally strong (minus perhaps the sangrias which are just sweet but yummy), their decor is elegant, and their service is generally spot on. There's a reason that this is (and will continue to be) one of my most visited places in Pittsburgh!
