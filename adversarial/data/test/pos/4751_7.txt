Their commercials are everywhere, but I had to go to Arizona to actually try some.\n\nIt's not bad, but it wasn't that great either. I got the #5: a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster with tots and a drink ($6.29). The burger was alright. The tots seemed a bit dry.\n\nAre we supposed to tip the waiters that rollerblade to your car window?? I think that was the first time I ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurant.
