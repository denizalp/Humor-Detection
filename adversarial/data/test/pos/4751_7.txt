I've had Sabor book marked for a while and since I was out and about and on that side of town I decided to stop in and finally give them a try. \n\nThe place is small, easy enough to find but definitely not fancy by any means. But they do have some outdoor seating which would be really nice when it gets a little warmer. \n\nThe ordering process is easy enough, the menu is listed on two large boards as soon as you walk in, and you simply place your order pay on the iPad and then wait for them to make it. \n\nI have to admit that I was pretty bummed I missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-5pm for $.99 tacos autenticos) but I found the prices here were pretty reasonable. \n\nAfter a quick chat with the guy taking my order and telling him it was my first time and asking for some suggestions I ended up ordering two tacos authenticos (one chicken and one steak), a chicken empanada and an order chips and guacamole. \n\nYep. All that...don't judge me. \n\nWhile I waited for them to get my order ready, I stopped by the salsa bar. It definitely didn't look like some of the pictures I've seen, a lot were either out or in squeezable containers but at least they had the super spicy green one that I'd heard was  super spicy and delicious. So I helped myself to a container of that and before I knew it my order was ready.\n \nTacos Authenticos: Classic. I preferred the chicken over the steak, but that's just my personal preference. I loved how all the flavors came together (especially the cilantro and lime juice). For an extra kick, add some of that spicy green sauce (which I'm sure has a proper name) and it's so good. \n\nEmpanada: Ok, first of all they are huge. Second they come packed with meat and fried up to golden perfection. And third, it was by far my FAVORITE part of the meal. My only complaint....I didn't order two. \n\nChips and Guacamole: The chips were seasoned and warm. I thought they were okay. And the guac was good, but nothing too special. \n\nDid I mention they have margaritas?\n\n I didn't have one this visit but you better believe that on my list of things to try when I return! Overall, I'd say this place is worth a visit.
