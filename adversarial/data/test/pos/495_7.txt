Stingray is everything that is wrong with sushi in America. This place is just for young, dumb pretty things, and the douchebags that hunt them, to go for a quick bite before hitting 7 different clubs. It is a bastardization and dumbing down of the sushi experience that leaves 1000s of people walking away saying: \"Yeah, I've had sushi. Sake bombers. Raw fish, big deal. It's fun.\"\n\nSushi isn't raw fish, it's a vinegared rice prepared in a specific manner to achieve perfect texture and flavor. That rice is then accompanied by various toppings, often raw fish. But you could eat an entire meal of real sushi and never touch raw fish. \n\nBoth times that I've fucked up and gone here, the sushi rice has been pathetic. Once so undercooked it was cracking in my teeth. The next, so mushy and over-sweetened it tasted like dessert.\n\nOnce, sat at the bar to try to get a little interaction with a \"chef\". I ask him what sashimi he recommends. His answer: \"it all comes in fresh daily.... whatever.\" WRONG ANSWER, tall white doofus \"chef\"!\n\nSR gets an extra star for being semi-cool looking for a rock n' roll sushi bar, and appearing to be clean, in the front anyway. And if you order the right stuff, it gives you something colorful to throw up later in the bathroom at Myst.\n\nIf you want real sushi: Hiro in Scottsdale, Shiro in PV, + multiple other venues, some I've yet to try but are getting good reports. Hell, even in a setting like the Metreon in SF, Sanraku is good Japanese. There seems to be a boom again, thankfully. But Ayako at the Biltmore will be missed for a very long time.\n\n(I could copy\/paste this same review for Zen32 and RA. Why retype almost exactly the same complaint?)
