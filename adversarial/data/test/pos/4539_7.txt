TTC is a horrible transportation system. Street cars, buses, and subways with no air-conditions in middle of summer and during heatwaves. I take the subway every day, morning and night, and almost on daily bases the subway between Bloor and Runnymede station has no air-condition. You walk in a subway-car and you can feel a wall of heat inside the car and everyone looks like they are dying. \n\nTTC CEO, You should be ashamed of yourself, charging people almost $143 a month and you can't even provide basic necessitates in middle of damn summer, underground, with temp reaching 40 +, and you run subways with no air condition? You fool. \n\n3rd world transportation systems run better than TTC. \n\nWhat an embarrassing state of affair.
