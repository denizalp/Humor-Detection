I had a horrible odor coming from a guest bathroom sink and then I thought the odor traveled to other sinks.  I finally decided to get a plumber to my house to fix whatever the problem was.  I found GNC Plumbing through Yelp and gave them a call.  He was able to come the next morning which was fantastic!  He suggested we clean out all eight p-traps and bleach them out since that was most likely the issue and why there was the odor.  He and his son took care of this quickly (within 40 minutes), and left no mess behind.  They are both very professional and very nice and that is a difficult combination to find these days.  The cost was more than reasonable and I will call upon Gary \/ GNC Plumbing again when I have a plumbing repair need. \nThank you for such a pleasant experience!
