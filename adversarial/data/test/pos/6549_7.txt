I am a current tenant, renting a home in Chandler, for about 8 months. We are going to be looking at renewing our lease for another year here shortly. Most of the reason why is the managements quick responses to work orders and the ease to put in work orders via online portal. The house is a tad older so some odd end items come up but that's expected.  So far the best at rental management company I've had when renting homes in the Valley. \n\nApplication process was easy and within a respectable time frame we were given updates etc. Online portal for rental payments is a breeze. Would recommend to friends\/co-workers.
