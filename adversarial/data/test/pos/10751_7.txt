Sifting through all the reviews and food show hype, Bally's Sterling Brunch was pegged as probably the best Sunday brunch around.  Located in the casino at the site of their steak house, the Sterling Brunch exudes a classy old-school style of dining.  Their selection of items can only be described as no-frills with many of the classic brunch staples that have withstood the test of time and found almost everywhere.\n\nBut this is where the similarity with many other brunches ends.  The caliber of items for an AYCE place is superior.  Who offers unlimited lobster tail, filet mignon, and caviar, with bottomless Perrier-Jouet champagne? \n\nThey have the standard omelette station, crepe station, waffles, etc.  \n\nI don't want to go into an exhaustive listing so I will just point out some of the noteworthy things.\n\nAustralian rock lobster tail - you can pile it on, not just take one please\nfilet mignon - tender\ncasino clams\ncaviar - not sure which but not cheap kind, mildly salty and not too fishy\nprime rib\nrack of lamb - cooked perfect\nseafood jambalaya\ngarlic truffle mashed potatoes\nsalmon egg benedict\nseafood in puff pastry\ncouscous with tilapia\ndessert bar - choc dipped strawberries, various cream desserts in glasses, choc brownie with peanut butter on a stick\n\nStay away from:\nsushi - not so fresh and a bit fishy\ncrab claws - mushy\n\nThey have bacon and sausage but no eggs.  Omelette bar though. No crab legs.\n\nIf you like to have a variety of different foods and novel offerings, this brunch may not be for you. There is no chocolate fountain either.\n\nService is impeccable.  One server per two tables.  Constant attention to your needs.\n\nNice change of pace to other Vegas buffets that tend to be a bit mediocre in quality.  \n\nPS - I have to share a conversation at the dessert bar with a girl, I'll call her Bimbo, and her friend.  As she looks at the long stem choc covered strawberries, she remarks - OMG how do they do that!?  \n\nThe dessert bar guy   - Oh they dip it one chocolate and then drizzle the other one over, creating the stripes.\n\nBimbo - No, I meant the stems, how do they make them so long?\n\nI then looked at the dessert guy and he was in shock. I was more than thrilled to help out.\n\nMe - Oh, they don't create it.  They just cut the strawberry with stem longer cuz it grows on a plant!\n\nBimbo - Wow. Who knew? (giggles)\n\nWhat I would have liked to have replied - If you were a zebra, you would be the first to be eaten by the lions, but you're not. So please, do us all a favor and don't have any children unless they discover stupidity skips generations.
