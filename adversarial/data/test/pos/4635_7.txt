Woo Hoo! Welcome back, Evelyn! What better way to kick of the fun than some tequila and tacos on a wonderfully windy patio! Seriously, if that wind hadn't been a blowin' I might have melted.  Staff were awesome, margs were spot on (although a little sour at the end-- but that didn't stop me;)) and the tacos were delicious and plentiful. \n\nWhat a great evening!
