Mustachio's makes the best veal sandwiches you can dream of. Everyone has been bothering me about California Sandwiches my whole life, and I couldn't care less about them. Mustachio's beats that place so hard, because they have delicious sandwiches, fast service, and...uh, the best sandwiches ever that you should have immediately (as in right now).\n\nHere's what you will do:\n\nYou will go to Mustachio's, and you will wait in line. When it's your turn, you will get a veal and eggplant sandwich. You'll ask for everything on it (including hot peppers), and your mouth might be on fire for a little bit, but later on, you will appreciate this tip because it makes the sandwich even better.\n\nYou'll go sit outside on the picnic benches of St. Lawrence Market on a nice day, and eat your Mustachio sandwich, and you will think, \"Wow, this is the best sandwich I have ever had. The veal is so lean and is the perfect thin cut of meat that has ever been breaded and fried. Why is this eggplant so deliciously crispy and tasty? And how is this bread so fresh? This sandwich is so amazing that I don't even care if I spill its contents on my jeans, I will probably pick them up and eat them anyways.\"\n\nAnd then you will think, \"I am so glad I searched for the best veal sandwich ever on Yelp. Now that I know Mustachio's is here, my life will never be the same.\"
