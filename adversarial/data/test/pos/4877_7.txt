Another one off the vegan bucket list! Onion Maiden is definitely one of the more unique restaurants in Pittsburgh. Despite their dark and heavy metal theme, the restaurant's atmosphere is very chill and relaxed. They have one small seating area so expect a 15-20 min wait during rush hours. \n\nTime for the food! I wanted to try a little bit of all the recommended items. The poutine was killer. They sub out the fries for tots and top it with a vegan gravy and vegan cheese curds. I'll have 5 more please. \n\nNext up was the vegan hot dog (sorry, \"dawg\"). I ordered the Trooper which is smothered in cashew cheese and lentil chili. I was skeptical of the topping choices but I actually loved it. So flavorful and probably the best substitutes for cheese and chili that I've had. I was not a fan of the texture of the hot dog itself or the baguette bread it came with. Maybe I'm just boring but hot dogs belong in hot dog buns. \n\nMy main course was the Woods which is a black rice bowl with fried tofu, wood ear, lily flower and kale. I was surprised by how flavorful it was. Texture wise, the black rice was very tough and when you pair that with other chewy toppings, it makes for a jaw workout. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't get it again.
