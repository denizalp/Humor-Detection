I'm embarrassed to admit it as a native Montrealer... But today was my first time at the famous Schwartz's. But, we waited outside in the cold in line for about 45 minutes, so I think i should be forgiven :) The decor is what I imagine it looked like when it first opened 80 years ago, minus some of the newspaper clippings on the walls.\nEveryone at our table had a classic smoked meat sandwich - I ordered lean and found it a little dry, so I added a touch more mustard. Those who had medium said the meat was perfect. The spice combination used here is different from what you'd find at other smoked meat places around the city.  The meat is flavourful, tender, and falls apart. The fries were good.  \nThe star of meal, you ask? A giant pickle! Quite possibly the best pickle I've ever had (and I consider myself a pickle connoisseur, even if nobody else does). I wanted to stop next door at the take out counter to bring some pickles home, but the take out counter was closed. So I'll be back - the pickle is worth waiting in line.
