This place is awesome! I've been meaning to try it for the longest time and I know I will be back! The baguettes are perfect and I love the distinction between the tradition Vietnamese sandwiches and the European. Also, the food is on the cheap here! It would cost me more to make the sandwiches at home (at least the traditional side of the menu). I paid for myself and two other people and spent less than $11. That made me so happy! I highly recommend this place and remember...\n\nBRING CASH! BRING CASH! BRING CASH!
