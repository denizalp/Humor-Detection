We finally made it over to check out the dessert selection at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop! I was in the mood for banana cream pie, they were out so we settled on a chocolate cream pie. A slice of pie is $4.50 so we decided on a whole pie for $15.00 which is 7 large slices. I like that they pre-slice the pie, very convenient and will avoid the mess of cutting it on your own, also the slices are equal size!\n\nMmmm this pie is yummy for sure, love the chocolate whipped mousse like cream filling and the white whipped cream they use is also tasty. The crust is flaky and tasty as well as the generous garnishment of shaved chocolate! This is a generous and rich pie, well worth the $15 bucks!\n\nThey had the old school style refrigerated glass cake and pie display case and a spinning display. That was a blast from the past for sure.\n\nWe selected from what they had already made. They had a strawberry shortcake cake with strawberries so large on top. I just could not bring myself to paying $36.00 for a cake when it is not even a special occasion. It sure looks delicious and I think next time I will get a slice to test it out first, I am sure is worth the money as it looked Divine!\n\nYou can call ahead for a special pie or cake request.\n\nAll cakes and pies are homemade on premise out of their bakery.\n\nThe options are mind blowing and all look Amazing!\n\nI can not wait for the next opportunity to try other pies and cakes!\n\nCakes...cheesecakes...pies galore all from scratch!\n\nCAKES...\n\nangel coconut cake, banana cake, black forest cake, black out cake, boston cream cake, carrot cake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate mousse cake, chocolate peanut butter cake, frost cake, Hawaiian cake, German chocolate cake, Kahlua cake, lemon white cake, m&m cake, marble cake, mango cake, orange cream cake, milk cake, Oreo cake, peanut butter cake, pineapple upside down cake, strawberry torte cake, strawberry shortcake cake, tres leches cake.\n\nCHEESECAKES...\n\nblueberry, cherry, chocolate, fruit delight, lemon, macadamia, peanut butter, Oreo, plain, raspberry, sour cream, Reese's, strawberry\n\nPIES...\n\napple, banana, blueberry, cherry, chocolate cream, banana cream, peach, lemon cream, pumpkin\n\n\nMmmmm yum for sure a great place to get a birthday cake and you can view the menu online and see the options from chocolate gonache to butter cream frosted cakes etc!\n\nDelicious baby!\n\nI have been missing out all of this time, I wish I had known sooner about this wonderful bakery!
