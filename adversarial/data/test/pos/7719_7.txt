Had fun on the Just Ducky Tour. In total, our tour lasted about 45 minutes or so. There was a driver and a tour guide. While the driver was funny and personable, the guide seemed to lack enthusiasm and a connection with the his audience. He was knowledgeable about the city. A few local landmarks were pointed out prior to entering the water. While in the water, we basically rode near the Science Musuem and Point State Park. Not exactly what I expected. One fun twist is that audience members had a chance to become the captain of the boat for a few minutes each. \n\nWould recommend as a one time adventure, but probably wouldn't do it again. For the overall price, I feel that more could be given in terms of the boat and land tour.
