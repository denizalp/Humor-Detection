Went for afternoon lunch to sit on the patio and just relax.  It was not very busy at all.\n\nOrdered some wine... Got the wrong sized glass... Not too much of a problem.  Ordered an appetizer which was received after the meal...  More of a problem.  Of the two entrees one was completely wrong...  So basically every step of the meal was messed up.  Oh ya... I was asked if I wanted some ketchup to which I replied sure.  But never got any ketchup.  Why offer if you will not bring it.  Didn't even get a pen to sign the bill.\n\nHere's an idea... If you can't remember what people order, then try writing it down.\n\nI've been here several times, but this time was my last... Terrible service which serves to negate any positives of the restaurant.  Just terrible service...  Really bad.  Our waitress should be fired... Not even an apology for all the errors.
