I found out about Neeziie through Instagram, and was interested in the 3D microblading because my natural brows are thin and circular. I live in DC, but saw that she was coming to New York, so I reserved my spot since it is only a 4 hour drive away. I thought it was odd that when you originally make your reservation they do not provide you with information of where they will be located in the city, but they assured that they would notify me within 30 days. I called them a month before my appointment and asked where exactly she would be located in New York, and was told that they did not have a location set yet. I was annoyed because I was planning on getting a hotel in New York, so I wanted to make sure that it would be close to where she was working. I waited another two weeks and called again to ask, and her assistant said that they still hadn't confirmed the location, so I went ahead and just booked my hotel in Times Square, but this was already the first sign that this establishment wasn't as professional as I expected. I called one more time the week before my appointment, left a voicemail with my phone number, and still did not get a call back.\n\nI never received a call at all to tell me where she was going to be located, but fortunately my sister was getting her brows done also, so they called her and she was able to share the information with me. When I got there, her assistant said that she had been trying to call me, but then when I asked her what number she had been dialing, it was the wrong number. I left voicemail's stating my phone number, so I have no idea how she did not have my correct number. I went in the back to get my eyebrows done by Neeziie, and noticed that it was a pretty dimly lit room, which made me question how well this would be done, but I just let it go because she was very nice and personable. I showed her pictures of how I usually wear my brows, and then said that she free hands the shape. She started by threading my brows, and then drew an outline of where she would insert the strokes. She did not spend much time on the shape which was a little unusual, because that's the most important part, but I trusted that she knew what she was doing from seeing pictures of her work. \n\nI felt pain the entire time she was doing the strokes. It was as if I did not have any numbing cream put on at all, but I made it through the process. My brows initially looked ok, but the room was dimly lit so I couldn't really see. It wasn't until I went to the bathroom that I realized the strokes were too light, and you could see the separation between my real brows and the strokes. I asked her if she could make those areas darker so that it would not look so obvious, and she told me that for people who have less hair to work with, sometimes that happens and if she went over it again it would not look like threaded strokes. I was not completely happy with how they turned out, but I could not force her to go over them again. When they healed and the skin peeled, the strokes were so light that I could barely tell that I had even gotten them done, and I still had to fill in my eyebrows. I feel like she tried to play it safe Instead of really giving me the shape I wanted, because she was not experienced enough and feared that she would mess my brows up. She definitely did not add enough strokes, nor took enough time to work with me to see how I wanted my brows to look. \n\nA friend referred me to a lady in Maryland named Quyen that does them also, but has way more experience than the two years Neeziie told me she had. I decided that instead of going back to Neeziie I would have Quyen re-do my brows. I paid Neeziie $500, and then had to spend another $300 a month and half later because I was not satisfied with her work, but it was a TOTALLY different experience going to someone who is more experienced! Quyen had a spa light (the kind when you get a facial) placed above you, so she can actually see your face clearly. She also free handed her outlines, but she drew it with a brow pencil first, and then showed me and asked if there was something I wanted to change and allowed me to draw it on. She let me to hold up a mirror to watch her the entire time that she was doing the strokes so that I could see and make changes. She had me sit up at least 10 times during the process to make sure my brows were even and perfect  and that she didn't miss any spots, and her numbing cream actually worked and I felt very little pain. She was a true professional and took her time to make sure my eyebrows were perfect the way I wanted them, and I could not tell my real brows from the strokes. My eyebrows looked thicker, shapelier, and natural looking. She even said that she was surprised I was charged $500 by Neeziie and it didn't even include a touch up. Neeziie barely gave me any strokes throughout the brow, which is only good for those who don't want to change much. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back to Neeziie.
