I was quite impressed with my visit at One18 Empire. I went to try out their Big Taste menu at lunch. Service was extremely prompt - I was with my coworkers, a party of 10, and were able to get in and out within an hour! Our server made sure to ask us right away what our timeline looked like to ensure we wouldn't be late in getting back to work.\n\nFor my lunch, I went with the smokey tomato soup and the grilled cheese sandwich (gruyere, tomato, fontina, dubliner, avocado mayo). Both were such great pairings (hello, tomato soup and grilled cheese, that's like a match made in heaven, duh!). I made sure to alternate each bite between sandwich and soup, while dipping the sandwich in the soup. I was also super excited to discover that their regular lunch menu is also only $15 (which includes the grilled cheese and tomato soup and many more options available).\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the vanilla bourbon cake. Honestly, it was meh.. but then again, I'm more so a savoury person, so I walked in bias to begin with. I knew I was there for the soup and grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nIt was a pretty darn good deal, $15 for a lunch that was super filling and tasty too! I'm very tempted to return outside of Big Taste to try their other lunches now.. or even just to get the grilled cheese again....
