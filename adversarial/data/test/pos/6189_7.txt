I have been here a few times over the past 365 days to meet buddies for this and that.  It's cozy and affords you the ability to chill out.  The bartenders display the perfect balance of attention.  Each time I have visited the bartenders shake hands and introduce themselves, and ask for my name.  This is how all local bar experiences should be but a majority fall short in this finer point of bar keeping.  I have never sat down down for the long haul but it could be easy to do here.  I have also never sampled the food at this location.  But if you looking for a place to check out ESPN while waiting for friend to talk shop with or looking to drop out for a minute..check into T-A and enjoy!
