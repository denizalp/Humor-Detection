My friend was able to find a good deal for this location so when we came to vegas it was my first time staying here. I usually stay at the Venetian with a lot of people and split it, but this time it was 4 people at the mirage. When I walked in, things felt old and used. It wasn't quite as luxurious as the Venetian. The room was somewhat small, things felt like they were just picked up from the floor and put on the bed. The bathroom was pretty small as well. The clients at this location are definately different than those that stay at the Venetian. The rooms are so far from the entrance that you have to walk so long to get to the elevators that bring you up stairs.
