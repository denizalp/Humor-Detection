SUPER!  Stopped by this place about 640pm for a manicure.  This place advertises that they close at 7pm. When it was apparent that were all booked up, my face froze with surprise when they said sure and asked that I return in 10 or 15 minutes. I came back after a Boba run at Defiled and they got me in. My gal was gentle, polite, and gave one helluvah hand massage!  My hands had a brief handgasm.  She did an excellent job!  When I left they were still taking walk ins.  Dedicated to quality and service.
