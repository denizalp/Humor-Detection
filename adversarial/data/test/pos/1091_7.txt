This place may be popular, but I found the flavors to be less than desirable. And the appetizer dim-sum items *way* too greasy, as if the fryer was not hot enough or something?\n\nThere was so much grease in the leek pancake-dumpling thing we ordered that I was able to perfect re-fry it the next day in a bone-dry skillet. (and it was still oily)\n\nThe other dumpling-like appetizer item was *also* literally dripping with oil when we picked it up with our chopsticks. But for some reason I don't think people care to notice because they feel like they've \"found this secret noodle spot\"?\n\nTheir popular Szechwan-style hand-pulled noodle soup bowl has a pretty boring and one-dimensional flavor: it was just spicy and red and not much else. Pretty unappealing if you ask me. I could care less about hand-pulled noodles if the broth sucks. Not to mention that I think hand-made noodles make a lot more difference in Italian cooking than they do in Asian cooking. The broth is king to me. I observed most of the non-Asian people \"loving\" The Noodle Man were busy eating their noodles and *not* drinking their broth. I'm the opposite. If the broth sucks, it's a fail. I got up and walked around: table after table, bowls and bowls full of undrunken broth! Nobody cares about drinking the broth! What a coup, Noodle Man! People are coming here and only eating your noodles, which cost like 5 cents to make, if that!
