I didn't even wait in line.  I came the two weeks before Christmas, in and out like a ninja.\n\nAnyway this is the best buffet I've ever eaten.  Surprisingly the butternut squash soup was the best dish.  The crab legs were great, if you like cold alaskan king crab legs, which I don't.  The prime rib was very respectable, about what you would get at a black angus or mid tier steakhouse.  All you can eat for those two items is already worth the thirty bucks.\n\nThe fish was fifty-fifty.  Half overcooked and half cooked correctly.\n\nA couple other things such as the veal and the freshness of the shrimp stood out.  \n\nDon't leave vegas without eating here.  You'll get a great meal, and if you like, pretend to be too good for it, if that's your thing.
