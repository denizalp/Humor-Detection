The parents, of which I am one, recovering from the horror which is Christmas (simple me, I kind of like it),  decided that our livers had not been sufficiently lacerated by the multiple retox extravaganzas.  No... we need to go out and relax on Boxing day and have more food, better food...with sauces!  Needless to say, women rule the world.\n\nAnyway on a evening expected to be quiet, 8 of us were treated to the private stone room.\n\nI am always amazed by Vincent.  The man is a work-a-holic, running the restaurant, catering and then seemingly throwing in the Saturday bazaar just so he does not have a moment off.\n\nOur group is known at Vincent's and Howie is possibly the most informed wine waiter in the valley.  He is just terrific as was the service in general.  Mr. Wine, who was not THE Mr. Wine this evening (we had a big gun with us), enjoyed a aged Bordeaux and a Chilean Cab.\n\nMrs. Foodie ordered her usual collection of dishes and found them all great.  The Salmon quessadilla  was remarkable and is just great with Chardonnay.  My grouper was perfectly cooked.\n\nBut the Rack...the Rack.  You know how at some places you go and get 3 or 4 little pieces for like $100 (OK, not that much, but still a lot)?  At Vincent's you get 9 wonderful, juicy pieces of perfectly cooked Lamb with lots of extra stuff.  Three (if I had them) thumbs up.\n\nThen dessert comes, and comes and comes.  We enjoy good Sauternes and, as is Vincent's habit (he just sends a bunch out), ALL the desserts were just yummy.   \n\nNormally we have heard from Mrs. Ambiance by now, however in the private room on a quiet night there was not much for her to judge.  I will report two things, one, although the place was relatively empty, there was a lounge lizard singing and a crowd of hip youngsters sitting around enjoying cocktails.  Very cool.  And. two, Mr. Vincent himself directed me to the WR (the guy does not rest).\n\nIf you need a big time formal retox, Vincent's is the way to go.  Speaking of which, after tiring myself out at Squash with another Yelper, and then climbing Squaw Peak (are you nuts? yes!) I was too tired to accompany the group to the Montelucia for  the retox boost.
