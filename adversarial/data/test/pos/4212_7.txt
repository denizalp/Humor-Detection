Merci Paris Casino! \nThis is such a beautiful casino! It's set up to look like it's at the base of the Eiffel Tower, with beautiful architecture, a sprawling casino floor with lots of slot machines. There are plenty of cocktail waitresses coming around on a regular basis to make sure that your drinks are full and that you're having a great time! \nThe craps table box man and stick man could have been better. They seem to hire a bunch of dealers who don't speak English clearly, but I guess that's what you expect when you're in Paris. The roulette dealer was the same way. \nThe casino is large with lots of places to eat or have a drink, with lots of comfortable seating. \nThe restrooms were clean, as was the whole casino. I'll certainly be back!
