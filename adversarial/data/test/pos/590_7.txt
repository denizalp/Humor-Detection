This place would have gotten 5 stars if not for its manager.  Wow.  We were very surprised with his careless and rather rude demeanor.  He actually seemed to enjoy it as well which made it frankly, a little weird.  We'd asked 3 times for forks but were never brought any.  We'd been served our appetizers which 3 of us couldn't eat with the chopsticks on the table.  It's Mexican\/Asian fusion so you'd think they might consider that not everyone eats with chopsticks and set the tables with forks - but there you are.  Regardless, after asking a 3rd time and still not receiving forks, one of us got up and happened to find the manager and ask for some.  Dang if that guy didn't cop an attitude right away, get defensive, then rude...and then almost sneer about it every time he later passed our table.  To say it was off-putting really would be an understatement.  This guy is dead weight.  They need to lose him.  How hard is it to say, \"Hey, sorry that happened?  Let me get you some.\"  \n\nThe food was delicious though - all of it!  Try the bacon wrapped dates, the calamari, the rock shrimp and the tacos!  The rolls were great too!
