Chapters, Borders, Barnes and Noble, whatever.\n\nIt's a mega-bookstore with a Starbucks on the 2nd floor. Free wifi.\n\nThe reason why I'm even posting is because this place has become essential to my circuit with a 3 yo tot, especially on rainy days.\n\nThere's a Thomas the Train table on the 3rd floor in the kids section, where my kid can play while I check email or play Angry Birds on the iPod Touch.\n\nBring your germkiller gels just in case.  Kids are germy.
