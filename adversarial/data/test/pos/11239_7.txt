Who ever labeled Le Thai as a beer garden needs to look up beer garden on Wikipedia. The beer menu was underwhelming, filled with a few overpriced Asian beers, Stella, and PBR. Fresh from a weekend in the mountains, we were ready to imbibe, but we ended up not ordering any drinks.\n\nThey do have a lunch menu that runs every day (except Sunday) from 11-3 for $9.95, but the portions are a little bit smaller. I would also check the receipt carefully as they tried to overcharge us for adding both beef and shrimp to the pad kee mao.\n\nI do like that they offered brown rice without an additional charge, and the food was decent, but nothing I would go out of my way for.\n\nParking: metered around the corner\n\nUPDATE: Response to owner's comment below. That's a lot of math for a simple meal, of which was not explained by the server when we ordered shrimp and beef. No one asked which is a \"main\" and which is an \"add on.\"
