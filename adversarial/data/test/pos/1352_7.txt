Fun spot to grab some drinks..... especially when you get to sit in the \"birdcage\".  \n\nDRINKS \nDrink menu was pretty inventive and we all liked our selections.  Typical expensive Vegas prices.\n\nSERVICE\nWe did find the waitress service too slow and ended up getting up and hitting the bar frequently to take care of ourselves.  \n\nMUSIC\nPretty good DJ was spinning and quite a few people were dancing.  I enjoyed screaming some early 2000's hits.
