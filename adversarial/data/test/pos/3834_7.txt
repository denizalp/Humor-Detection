We began taking our animals to Graham Rd Animal Hospital about 2 years ago. I was never blown away with the place and its cleanliness. Their is a nasty smell that hits you right when you walk in. Im not sure what it is, but have complained about it to the staff and they act like they've heard the complaonr before. I also learned early on that I prefer Dr. Kline Jr over his father, Dr. Kline Sr. The elder Kline is very direct and in my opinion rather rough with our animals. We have a 15 yr old dog who had infected anal glands. Granted, I know that this is no picnic for my pooch or the vet, but he abruptly grabbed my dog by his collar and started \"examining\"! He wasn't trying to go easy or verbally calm my dog. Didn't explain anything he was doing at all. So, when I asked the receptionist at the front desk to note in our account that we prefer not to see Sr. any further, she became very harsh and annoyed with my request, but i chalked it up to a bad day for her. Fast forward to 12\/13 when we got a new puppy. Our visits became more frequent with the demands of a new puppy and their care. Our pup was born deaf and suffers from severe separation anxiety mostly because of his disability. The doctors present themselves in a very rushed manner and lack answers...or even suggestions! I could never ask questions about our puppy and get a full answer. I would hear a lot of \"Well, I don't have much experience with deaf dogs.\" I do have to say that Dr. White did email me later from her home with some training advice and contact info for local trainers.  I really appreciated that gesture and realize that she went above and beyond for us. The final straw was when our geriatric pup had another ear infection. I ran out of the wash, which I purchased from them months prior....without and appointment! I went in and asked the younger girl working the desk if I can purchase another bottle of ear wash. She snapped at me and told me I need an appointment to have our dog seen. I told her that I didn't need an appointment last time and the bottle was $12 and I paid and went on my way without an appointment. She went back to ask the doctor. When she came back 5 minutes later she asked what brand we had used. I couldn't remember off hand and I mentioned it should be in our dogs chart. She huffed away, returned with his chart and handed it to me! I asked what is that? She replied \"His chart. You'll have to look through it yourself because I have work to do!\" What?! Isnt taking care of a customer your job?! told her to forget it and we won't be back. She shrugged her shoulders as if she could care less. So... today we took our puppy to Wyoga Lake Vet and loved them!!
