Been here several times\nParking and getting in may be difficult \nMy parents gave me thier Diamond Cards, so I get seated promptly\nService is good whether you sit at the bar or tables\nNever sent anything back, \nIt's a chain so expect a lot of tourists walking in from the street \nBut I have been there with several local friends. \nNice bartenders \nGreat gift shop too.
