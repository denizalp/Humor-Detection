I don't think we need another review of this wonderful little eatery. All that's been said is all that needed to be said about how good the pizza is and how the price may need adjustment. \nSo here's some tips while eating there.\nMondays are half off pizza for dine-in all day. For dinner: go early or bring patience. The wait can get pretty long. Lunch was not as packed but \"you never know on Mondays\" said our waitress.\nIf you are up for an appetizer, their Bosco Cheese-Filled Breadsticks is a must have! Yep, gooey cheese encased by nice tasting bread with savory marinara dipping sauce.\nOh yeah, if you are lactose intolerant like me, you need to medicated before dining .
