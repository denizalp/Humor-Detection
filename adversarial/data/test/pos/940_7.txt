Revolving sushi it's always fun for the novelty factor! It's what you would expect quality wise, it is yummy but not the highest quality! I loved the cream puffs, which are something I don't usually like but these were not overly sweet.  The gyoza were absolutely  delightful. I also thoroughly enjoyed jalape√±o poppers!! The service is iffy, both times I've been they have been pretty abrupt and this last time they didn't bring my friend the drinks she ordered at the very beginning, she had to ask a second time after quite a bit of time when the server came back around. Overall it's a fun place for the conveyor belt experience.
