what can i say..such a dissapointment. I have never eaten raw dough before and this place serves it neatly in a plate. The ravoili was store bought and they claimed it was freshly made. I am never coming back to this place and especially since the owners feel they know best. That is not how to run a restaurant. Be respectful to your staff and customers. They are the backbone of your business.
