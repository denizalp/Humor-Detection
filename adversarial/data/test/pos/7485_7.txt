Once upon a time there was a magical pseudo-English place here - \"Pub\". It had a very nice atmosphere, good beer but most importantly - boys in kilts. What do we have now? Good beer is gone. So are the kilts. Instead I and my Russian girlfriends have 50+ fully dressed  (thank God) men checking us out and  some sour wine with generic calamari. \nAnd yes, I might not remember the food at the \"Pub\" because my focus was elsewhere, but nevertheless I want it back. \nNo we want it back. Kilts, mass-produced portraits of royal family and did I say kilts?\nUntil then - we are boycotting the place. Amen.
