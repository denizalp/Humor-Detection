Just finished a gel mani and pedi with the ladies at Nu Nails (Kim and Vi), and they did an amazing job! \n\nNot only are the ladies super talented; they're also personable, funny and attentive! I told them about some unfortunate gel experiences I've had lately (my last gel mani from a different local salon only lasted 6 days). They really took the time to do it right, and even helped me select a color that looked best with my skin tone. Both my manicure and pedi look AWESOME! A million trillion times better than my last few shady manis from other salons locally. \n\nOh, and the other deets: I did make an appt, and they promptly sat me in the pedi chair at my scheduled time and started right away. I'm glad I did as they seemed pretty busy for a weds after work. They had 5 people working and everyone had someone in their chair the entire time I was there. Their prices are very fair (even cheaper than some of the other salons nearby) and well worth it! They even do a relaxing hot stone massage complimentary with every pedi (not an upgrade)! It literally lasted for 10 minutes it seemed like!!! Tons of colors to choose from for both regular polish and gel polish... And they do lots of pretty nail art, though I didn't get any but the lady next to me did!\n\nI may be a NU client to Nu Nails (see what I did there), but I will certainly be back as one of your regulars! Thanks ladies!!! \n\nPS- I will be back after my Hawaiian vaycay to show you how tan the nail polish you picked for me made me look! :)
