I'd rate it a 3.5 if Yelp let me. So we were walking around after we went to get some things and decided to try this place out. It has a nice out door sitting area and inside there's some more seating. \n\nThe girl working (Marbella I think?) wasn't that friendly. She seemed like she didn't want to be there. I asked to Doctor Pepper since they only have Pepsi products and she responded saying \"it's been tasting flat all day.\" Okay? Go change out the syrup? I'd understand if they were out of that but if you have it and purposely don't change it, that's just lazy. We were asking what kind of energy drinks they have (only rockstar) and she responded \"it's not part of the special.\" We know. Thats not what we asked you. Smiling every once in a while wouldn't hurt either. \n\nThey have beer so it's always good. Mostly domestics but they do have Fat Fire so that caught my attention. You can buy a pizza for $20 or buy it by the slice. They have Stromboli's for $8 so we decided to try two slices and split a Stromboli. 2 slices and a drink for $8, not bad. Especially since the slices are too big to even lift! \n\nNow we got cheese pizza since that was the special. The marinara sauce needed some salt. It was great besides that. The Stromboli was really good. Amazing amount of cheese (never too much cheese) and pepperoni but also needed some salt. When I added salt, everything came together so much more. We both agreed that the Stromboli was better than the pizza itself! I enjoyed this place. I'll definitely come back!
