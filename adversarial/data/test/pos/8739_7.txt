I'm going to tell you a little secret about this swank, classy hotel.\n\nThis secret belies the glossy appearance of the vast expanses of marble in the foyer.  This secret doesn't immediately match up with the cosmopolitan guests you see walking the halls of this upscale hotel.  This secret doesn't jive with the sexy and modern dcor of the spacious suites.\n\nThe secret is that this posh hotel is perfectly suited to the young urbanites of the world that come to Vegas to party.\n\nAllow me to elaborate with a purely hypothetical situation.\n\nMaybe you're sitting in the lounge area of your suite with a handful of your friends.  You're gearing up for a big night out.  You suddenly realize your lacking supplies.  So you call down to room service and order two pillows, two blankets, three glasses, two ashtrays and a partridge in a pear tree.  Room service won't bat an eyelash.  (Hint: They also won't bring you the partridge.)\n\nSuppose that you return from a big night on the town, you've indulged in every vice that Sin City has to offer theoretically, you might wake up the next morning with your closest friends and newfound acquaintances to find that the morning hours have passed you by.  A maid knocks on the door and you quickly, but kindly inform them you are still occupying the room.  The housekeeping department will soon call you and schedule a time that would be conducive to your debauchery.  (Hint: Housekeeping overlooks quite a bit of the evidence from your decadent behavior that you might indiscriminately leave around the room.)\n\nI should also mention that THEhotel features the most comfortable mattresses found outside of my very own bedroom.\n\nLastly, THEhotel features THEstore.  Conveniently located at the bottom of the elevators,  you can buy half bottles of booze for roughly twice what you would pay at your local purveyor of spirits.  Yet this cleverly still works out to be cheaper than two drinks at the THElounge.
