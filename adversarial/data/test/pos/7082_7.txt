I've been to The Ossington a few times now. The mood of this Ossington Ave bar changes dramatically based on the crowd. (Did I need to mention this bar is on Ossington? Whatever.) On nights like Saturday there is a DJ pumping gratuitous beats while nearly 1,000 people squish violently to get drinks prepared with haste. I avoid such nights and you should too. \n\nOther times however, it's a reliable local pump. There is a pretty spacious front room where you can cozy up to the bar, enjoy a pint at a window seat or sit at the long pew-like benches with a group. I liked the low-ceilinged den of a back room also, which is dimly lit and has a long table perfect for meetups with ne'er-do-wells or young neocons or whatever circle you travel in.\n\nFoodwise: I've only ever picked at the meat and cheese platter when other people order it, and it's pretty decent. It comes with a HUGE (like seriously guys) pickle and a shot-glass full of dijon. No complaints there. I've heard that they have sandwiches here, but that could just be a rumour. I usually come here to do one thing and it rhymes with 'get crunk' so I'll have to report another time on their edibles. But as for potables: two shaky and dehydrated thumbs up.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: The wonderful wizard of OSS.\n\nMenu Readability: I vaguely recall stuff scrawled somewhere.\n\nNeed to mention: Bottles of PBR and Labatt 50 are CHEAP here. Great for buying rounds for the posse.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I need to man up on the meat\/cheese platter next time.
