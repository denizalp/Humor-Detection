I was dreading going into this location because I thought it was inside of the hospital and I would be there forever waiting to get tested.  It was a little hard to find but it's in one of the complexes behind the hospital.  Luckily, I was in and out in no time.  The staff was super friendly.  I came in for a pre-employment drug screening and cracked jokes with the lab tech.  Good times.
