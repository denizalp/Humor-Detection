Wait Soul food & Music...\n\nSo you're telling me that I can get a plate of chicken & waffles and I ain't gotta sit next to plaid Hipsters that wreaks of scented oils & too much beard wax?\n\nWait. \n\nSoo, you're telling me I can hear Live music Thursday, Friday, & Saturday and I ain't gotta listen to the gossip of Club-Slut-Bimbos talking in text (OMG!) Twitter or Facebook?\n\nHold up.  \n\nSo you're telling me that I can bring my own beer, sit in a room of my peers, Jaw jackin, having a drink, dancing without dealing with Snottsdale douche baggery? \n\nYou have made a friend for life, Rags. Blessed are the patrons of food and\nMusic. \n\nAnd you gotta meet this dude, Rags. Legit from head to toe. Reminds me of being in the South where this kinda hospitality is legendary.
