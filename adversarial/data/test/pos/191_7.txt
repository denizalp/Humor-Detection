We heard from people who frequent Las Vegas that Earl of Sandwich is a much try. When I saw the store front, I thought how good can a sandwich made by a chain restaurant be this hyped up. We decided to order two hot sandwiches and potato salad to go and eat it at the airport. \n\nI ordered the Pastrami Reuben with pastrami, swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and sandwich sauce. My boyfriend order the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce. We had half of each other's sandwiches so we can taste it. Boy, it was soooo good I wanted more after I finished each half! It was like just enough to make you wanting more. Ugh, such a tease. I wish the sandwiches were bigger because I was still hungry. The pastrami tasted like it was made in house. Yummy! \n\nGrab some sandwiches for the road. It's okay to eat two because they're small. Hehe! Next time I come back, I'm gonna order the The Full Montagu!
