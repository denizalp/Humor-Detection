Chelsea's kitchen has great customer service they sent me a message regarding my last visit\/review and offered me a e-comp to return to the resturant and give it another try.  I came here with my boyfriend and our roomate + his gf.  She was visiting so we thought why not go to a fancy brunch?  We were sat promptly and I showed our waitress my e-comp.  We ordered our appetizer and sangria.  Sangria at 11am .. definately a splurge for us.  It was kind of the same as last time minus all the people.  They weren't packed this time but the service was REALLY slow, I say really slow this time because we came when it was open.. there weren't much people there.  Our server was very nice, we ordered ahi tuna guac, sangria, crab benedict, short rib hash, mac & cheese, and a burger.  \n\nAhi guac- this was actually better last time, seemed to be too much guac and not enough tuna this time.  Still tastey none the less.\n\nSangria- awesome like always\n\nCrab benedict- It was a bit on the heavy side but I'm assuming that the dish itself, hollandaise sauce + crab + eggs + bread = too much too fast.  Maybe if the hollandaise sauce was lighter?\n\nShort rib hash- Again this was my order that turned out to be my least favorite one.  I had high expectations for this because the short rib tacos were so good last time.  However it was a dry disaster.  There were barely any potatos at the bottom and no flavor.  Am I always the unlucky one that gets the worse dish or is it that I have such high expectations? I'm not sure but everyone had a taste and they did not like it.. commenting it was too dry.  \n\nMac & cheese-  If you were in heaven and there was mac & cheese on the menu they would be serving you Chelsea's kitchen's mac & cheese.  They had jalpenos pieces inside that gave it a little kick, AMAZING.  \n\nBurger- friend said it was like any other burger, not worth the price.  \n\nAfter reevaluating I would have given this place 2 stars, but the mac & cheese deserves a star of its own.  A place this beautiful makes you expect their food to be amazing.  They should really re-evaluate their head chef, whoever it is should be stepping up for a place this beautiful. \n\nAll in all I again I felt like the place was nothing over the top except the prices. I am all for paying top price for a great meal but the food really isn't worth the prices. Pretty hefty tab we racked up...even with the e-comp.
