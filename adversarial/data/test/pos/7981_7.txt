You are all sheep for loving this place.\n\nf I want boring, uninspiring, factory made americanized italian  food, drenched in cheese, like EVERYTHING in cheese, then I will come here. \n\nYuck. Every one of my three courses was sub-par and was either cheesy or too salty, or both. I would have never walked in the door if I hadn't gotten a gift card from someone who should have known better.\n\nF'in hate this place.  Could have cooked a better sauce at home blind folded.  Did I tell you how much I despise these kinds of places?
