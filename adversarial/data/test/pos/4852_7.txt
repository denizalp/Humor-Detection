My friends were able to get the 4 of us a 8:15pm reservation on our first night in Vegas - which happened to be a Thursday. I was super excited to try this restaurant as I've had the Yountville location bookmarked for some time now--and of course, Thomas Keller is one of my favorite celebrity chefs.  I'm still working my way through his cookbook but to this day, several items in there are my go-to recipes and are my most favorite.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a booth on the back side of the restaurant. I was pleased with this seating arrangement because the tables in the center did not look as cozy and the bench seating provided us a lot more room to spread out and get comfy.  It's probably not so \"french bistro\" but in the end, It proved to be more private and much more intimate for our group. \n\nFor starters, the Epi (branch leafed bread) they immediately deliver to your table is irresistible and clearly made in house.  It was so fresh. We cleared both loaves before our appetizers were even out. The warmth of the bread, the crunch of the crust and perfect center -  along with the creamy, room temperature butter left me with no self control. It must've been obvious because the bus boy brought another loaf and even gave us an entire bag of bread on our way out along with a little wink. Cute. \n\nWhile we all ordered our own dishes, we all kind of tasted each others plate so i'll give you the low down for each item ordered and what I tasted:\n\n* Bone Marrow Appetizer (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#IFq8fcrtUt9SsxQm6DbpQg): We ordered this for the table to share (minus my hubby since he doesn't do what he calls,\"weird\" food).  He missed out because this was so rich and full of flavor, I could've had this as my meal. We licked that plate clean. I could not get enough and craved more!  ORDER IT!  \n\n* Endive Salad (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#sfV5ar3nyCDXMd2dYIRn6w): Since my hubby didn't indulge in the marrow, this was his appetizer. It was very tasty and the presentation was beautifully done with the endive leaves placed strategically on the plate as if a house of cards. The vinaigrette was not at all overpowering.  With the roquefort cheese and the nuts, it was nicely balanced. \n\n* Smoked Salmon Appetizer (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#kaFzihNKLmZyvcT5RR92Bg): Good things come in small packages. Presentation was simple - served in a small glass canning jar along with baguette slices.  I actually stole an endive from my hubby's salad and the salmon actually went really well with it. This appetizer was tasty but if I had to choose between this or the Bone Marrow, this wouldn't stand a chance.\n\n* Trout (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#2xOHkIxvWabr3zIB1ITElw): Seriously...this dish was off the hook! My friend also ordered this dish and we both agreed it was unbelievable.  We were both full but we kept going until every last morsel of fish was in our belly. The buttery croutons sprinkled on top were an unexpected addition but couldn't have been more perfect. I might have to steal that from him next time I prepare fish at home. Also, loved the presentation with the head on. It made my husband squirm but hello...he married a Filipino!  Get used to it!  \n\n* Roasted Chicken (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#CijX0I2eVnH2eXejPOrk4A): Hubby ordered this one. I got a bite and the skin was nice and crispy, the meat was tender and had lots of flavor. He loved it and I enjoyed the bite I got.\n\n* Short Ribs (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#dmhLzxDCxt-KbyYgkG1FSg): My girlfriend ordered this and loved it. I was so stuffed, I couldn't take another bite of anything else. She was very pleased with her order. \n\n* Dessert (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#VZNaOGdvtZbpA2dw-8gmjw): Our awesome waiter wouldn't let us leave without dessert and insisted we get one that wasn't on the menu; Mini chocolate cakes with zest from a blood orange. This was served with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream on top, slices of flesh from a blood orange as well as several julienne candied orange zests. If you really like orange flavored desserts, you'll enjoy this.\n\nThe dining experience here was fantastic and I just think Chef Keller is a genius with how he approaches his menu. Everything we had far exceeded my expectations and made me one happy and full girl.  I look forward to coming back and trying their brunch next time...and of course, dinner (again).  \n\nGreat job, Team Keller!
