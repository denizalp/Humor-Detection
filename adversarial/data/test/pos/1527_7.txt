Rating is 3.5 stars.\n\nGood BBQ pork, okay roast duck.  Considering the lack of competition in the vicinity, this place could have gotten away with lower quality food, but it doesn't.  My respect.  \n\nWhat takes down the rating from 4 stars to 3.5 stars is the pricing.  BBQ Pork is $8.99\/lb.  Most Chinese BBQ joints in Markham and Scarborough charge closer to $6.99, including the good ones.  Whole roast duck is $1 to $2 more expensive than 2 of my favourite BBQ joints in Markham and Scarborough.\n\nJust so you know - pretty good BBQ food, but expensive.
