A 4.5 star gelato but the owners are fantastic and truly interested in creating a great experience so it pushes it to a 5 star.  Quick note.. CASH ONLY!!\n\nThis seasonal little store just off of St.Clair is a gem.  A simple and cute storefront with 3 chalkboards outlining their daily offerings.  The mostly have 3 types... gelato soft serve,  chocolate covered Gelato bars, and their sundaes with their soft serve.  All $5 including tax so yes, it is expensive than the McD down the street but its like comparing a piece of concrete to a diamond.  \n\nThey have several benches you can sit down outside the storefront and even though it wasn't warm (13C), they have many people come through enjoy their treats.  No line ups though (unlike a 30+ min one on Ossington).  \n\nAs mentioned, super friendly owners serve you and they're great with everyone.  Just smiles and answers all around for everyone.  We got one of each type to try... caramel sundae (with looks like a vanilla soft serve base), a chocolate and mango gelato soft serve twist, and a  raspberry gelato with a chocolate shell.\n\nCaramel sundae ... Hands down, one of the best caramel sauces in Toronto.  Honestly.  It is buttery, rich caramelized notes, and a nice hit of salt to enhance the overall sweetness.  It was a super generous pour to the amount of vanilla soft serve.  Just a great choice.  5+\/5\n\nChocolate and Mango gelato twist ...  I wasn't sure what to expect as part of the appeal of gelato is the ability to whip a lower milk fat into a creamy iced treat.  With a soft serve, its served warmer than traditional gelato.  From a texture point of view, if you told me this was gelato... I wouldnt' have necessarily guessed it since it missed the more creamier and melted velvety texture.  BUT the flavours are good... true mango sweetness and a chocolate that was more towards darker chocolate.  It wasn't a true punch of flavours like a traditional gelao but for a soft serve, its a solid good rendition.  4\/5\n\nRaspberry Gelato wtih chocolate shell ... Raspberry flavour was just so good.  Bright, bold, sweet and yet tart.  I would say this is a favourite especially since this was barely shared beyond one person haha.  The dark chocolate was a nice compliment to the raspberry.  Once again, the texture isnt a traditional creamy whipped gelato but the flavour stands out as being very good. 4.5\/5\n\nI can see people chirp on this place for not offering giant servings but when you have flavours pop as well as this place, I think it speaks to quality over quantity.  I honestly want to eat something amazing instead of lots of mediocre.  I also like supporting a local business that clearly is passionate at what they do.  So for me, totally worth every penny I can hand over and over and over again.
