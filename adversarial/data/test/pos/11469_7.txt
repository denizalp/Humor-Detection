This Jimmy John's can be summed up as follows:\n\n1) Delicious #4 Turkey Tom, hold the mayo, add avocado, onions and sprouts. \n\n2) Nasty, rude AF employees. \n\nI came in here on the way to my weightlifting competition on 2\/4 to pick up a giant sandwich to inhale after weigh-ins. \n\nThe woman at the counter (around 10:40 AM) didn't acknowledge my presence except with a nasty look. Didn't utter a single word the entire time I was there. \n\nSeriously, I was the one who had been water and carb cutting all week - If I can not have a crusty attitude after that, you can be a decent human being. \n\nIt costs $0.00 to provide decent customer service, and you can even fake it. Whoa, dude! \n\nYeah, kick rocks, I'll go a couple miles down the street to the San Tan Gateway location even though this one is practically steps away from the gym.
