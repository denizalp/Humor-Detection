Secrets don't make friends, so that's why I'm here to tell you allllll about it.\n\nIn my world, guys are natural-born pizza connoisseurs.  Therefore, any pizza rants from my guy friends are treated like the word of God.  When my friend told me that him and his bros were able to demolish a whole box of pizza from here, AFTER COMING FROM A BUFFET, I knew this place was legit.\n\nJust order the white pizza with ricotta cheese and mozzarella, and you're golden.  It was greasy. It was cheesy. It was simple. It was one of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth.\n\nEvery pizzeria I go to now, I check to see if they have the white pizza, but sadly I haven't found an alternative in SF or Socal yet.
