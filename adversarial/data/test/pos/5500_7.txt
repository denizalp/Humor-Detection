If you don't like this place, you're racist.\n\nJust joking.\n\nI had the fried chicken and ribs dinner, which included a breast and a wing of their unbelievably crispy and delicious fried chicken, two large ribs, which were tender and smothered in tangy bbq sauce, and a side of mac and cheese and baked beans (both great).  As many on this site have written, the decor and location aren't the best, but don't let that discourage you.  If you're in the mood for southern style soul food and in Cleveland, check out Hot Sauce Williams post-haste.
