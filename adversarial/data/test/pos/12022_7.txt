Ever since my visit to Bagel World, I've been reminding myself to sit up straight. If you see the kyphotic waitress who served us, you'll know what I mean. She's awesome, by the way.\n\nI had the whitefish salad[1] on a poppy bagel ($7.95). It's served with slices of tomato, onion, and cucumbers. The bagel was fine untoasted; dense and chewy the way I like it. The whitefish salad, on the other hand, was dry. I'm used to having it with more mayonaise and this was so flaky, I could barely get it to schmear.\n\nThe coffee is the standard deli coffee but at least ours was served super hot, fulfilling Shari M's desire to peel a few layers of skin off the mouth.\n\nAfterthoughts: (a) I'm still on the hunt for good whitefish salad. (b) Why is their humongous chocolate pastry called a buffalo? I've never heard of this and I need to know!\n==================================\n[1] Because I know all you Gentiles have no idea what this is: http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/2008\/04\/whitefish_salad.html
