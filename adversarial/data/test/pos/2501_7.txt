I can not say enough Good Things about Stagioni's from the moment I walked in I felt welcome! We were Warmly Greeted by the Manger and we were seated immediately. The Staff came over to our table immediately and served us water and warm bread while we looked over the menus.\n\nThe Decor puts you in the mind of Tuscany and is very appeasing to the eye. The intricate details gives your eye something new to explore at all times.  The Kitchen is open to the restaurant so you are able to get a peak at all of the delicious food that is coming out! The best thing about all the pastas and breads are that they are made in house!  Being that I was with a Group of Friends we decided to order an array of different dishes and drinks to do tastings. We order the Meatball Pizza, Rigatoni, Steak Florentine, and my all time favorite the Mushroom Risotto!! It was so good! We topped everything off with the tiramisu cheesecake it will not disappoint!!! \n\nI would say this is a Great Place for Date Night and socializing with friends! Be sure to make reservations early this place fills up quick.
