One of our regular Vegas hotels. Vdara is THE BEST. No casino on property means less foot traffic, less smoke, and much quieter at night. One of the only DOG FRIENDLY properties on the strip. \n\nClose proximity to Aria and Bellagio, and Cosmopolitan. And a short walk to LV Blvd. You can get the tram too between Bellagio, Aria, Crystal Shops and The Park (formerly Monte Carlo) so you can access T-Mobile arena also without a ton of walking. \n\nThere's a great pool deck with a bar and food service and it's not a ridiculous party pool. Much quieter and family like. \n\nThere is a Starbucks and a lobby bar plus a small eatery in the first floor area. Room service also so everything you'd need while in Vegas. \n\nThe rooms are nice from the standard suites to the City Corner Suites to the larger Deluxe Suites we've tried them all. Very modern. Very spacious. \n\nParking is covered if you reach Pearl Tier with MGM MLife Rewards, never had any issues with the valets. Lyft and Uber are also close by with pickups between Aria and the City Center area. \n\nTons to do nearby. Great rates and awesome service. We've relied on Vdara over a dozen times in the past few years and always look forward to going back. \n\nVegas baby!!
