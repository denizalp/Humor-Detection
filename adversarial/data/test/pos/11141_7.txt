Went here for brunch with a couple of friends on Sunday.  Nice little place on church. I got eggs with home fries, toast and  pea meal. Not sure if I will go back.\n\nFood: 2.5\/5, my eggs were way too runny for what I usually go for. The pea meal and the fries were good though.\n\nService: 3\/5, not too bad, a lady with Indian type of clothing came by often to check us. It was nice but a bit too much.\n\nAmbience: 2.5\/5, little place with nice decor but the seats were quite uncomfortable.\n\nPrice: 1.5\/5, about $15-20 per person.  They have wrong prices on the menu which is a big problem for me, I got charged more and had to ask why.
