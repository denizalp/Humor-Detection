So much fun taking classes here!! I had been creeping their videos on social media for a while but was too scared to take a class. I had never taken hip-hop before. I worried I'd stick out awkwardly or be too old! Now I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out. It really is a place anyone can drop-in to. Staff and teachers are super approachable and the vibe is welcoming. Yes, the advanced classes have really intricate choreography and the dancers are killing it, but everyone has to start somewhere:) Facilities are spacious and clean. They recently were closed for a few weeks due to water damages, but now everything is back up and running. Change rooms have showers (which are a good idea after House -- it's a crazy cardio workout) but no lockers. Most people bring their purses into the studio. The variety of styles offered is excellent (many genres of street dance, plus themed classes like Beyonce or \"Find Your Fierce\"!). I have only tried hip-hop and house so far. I definitely recommend TUDC for a fun time.
