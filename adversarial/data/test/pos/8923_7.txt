My coworker and I go here often.  We know the staff and they are always helpful and nice.  One thing they do well is a good cold-brew coffee.  The other thing they do right is their bread and baguettes.  Go there to try any soup they have on special.  They also do a great short rib sandwich on occasion.  In this part of Scottsdale there really isn't any place that is close for indie coffeeshops.  \n\nParking is the only complaint as the bank next door has RESERVED signs up on more than a few spots.  So does TCBY and some of the other businesses in the shopping center.  It has gotten a lot more bearable in the summer months, however.
