Great place to stop if you need something in a pinch.  Its a tad pricey and I couldn't see myself doing regular shopping here.  The Market 15 minutes away has all the same stuff but cheaper.  Prepared foods are good.  Veg can be a tad on the older side sometimes.  Staff is always pleasant, even though the place is packed.  Glad to see people in Parma eating vegetables and fruit.   God knows America needs to head more in that direction....
