Too bad they don't have these in every casino. Mostly just in the station casinos & the Palms. It's childcare for gamblers. Drop your kid off for up to 4 hours and enjoy. They have everything for the kids. A playland like McDonald's, video games(ps3,wii,xbox,etc) plus they have a snack bar so they can eat whenever they get hungry. It's usually $6\/hr but if you have a young one and want to enjoy a movie,dinner or just gamble your kids will love you even more for letting them go wild at Kids Quest. The one at the Palms is small & mostly for very young kids. The best one is at the Red Rock Casino.
