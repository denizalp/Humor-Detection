The only 'help' offered by the staff in a dead empty showroom....if that's what the walk-in closet is called, was to be told that they had lost the remote for a $350 fan when I asked to see it in action. Really? And you work selling...ceiling fans. No universal remote? No calling the vendor to get another?  Nah...just don't bother... I get it. Oh, then tell me that that model only comes with plastic blades when I've seen it all aluminum elsewhere. Hey, if you don't want to actually sell shit, don't stock shit and why not talk shit when you don't know shit. I'm in desperate need of like...five fans; way to blow your commission and my lid.
