OMG - I am about to get very fat, since the Larry moved into our building. \n\nThe food is out of this world, and the service is killer. They have not been open long, and I'm already on a first name basis with much of the staff. The cocktails are delightful and ambiance is chill. \n\nThe restaurant is surprisingly versatile - great for a business lunch or cocktails with friends. My only complaint is that they are so close to where I work (within 70 feet), because I have no self restraint, and intend to eat my way through the entire menu.
