We just paid 27 bucks plus tax for \"award winning water\" that tasted exactly like the tap water at every other restaurant on the Strip. I can only imagine there are a bunch of guys in the back of the kitchen refilling those blue and red bottles from the tap and laughing hysterically as they unwittingly charge all the idiots in the restaurant like us big bucks for it. \n\nSeriously though, the entire meal was like a caricature of a dining experience. The service was so stuffy and our server acted completed offended when my wife asked if they could make a small change to one of the items. I mean, how dare she ask to alter one of \"Chef Ramsay's\" signature dishes!?!?\n\nAfter that the server acted like our table of plebes wasn't worthy of this amazing \"Chef Ramsay\" experience. \n\nBut let's focus on the food, because that is, after all, the primary reason we came. The beef wellington was by far the most overrated restaurant dish I have ever tasted. Yes, the cook and texture of the steak was fine. The pastry was completely flavorless and soggy and I scraped it off of my meat and didn't even finish it. The pureed potatoes and vegetables were cold. When I mentioned it the response was, \"oh well those are really only for garnish anyway\". Really? I have to believe the kitchen is just mass producing beef wellingtons and our pre-made plate must have been sitting forever waiting for the steak to hit. \n\nProblem is, the reality here fell far short of the expectation. If you watch Gordon Ramsay on TV you'd be led to believe he's a perfectionist who would never allow cold food to go out on a plate, and yet there it was, in a restaurant with his name on the door. \n\nReally disappointing.
