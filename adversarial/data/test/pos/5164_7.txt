I went to college in Pittsburgh, and had more than my fair share of drunken nights at \"The O,\" but haven't been back for over 15 years.  When I was back in town, I HAD to go back.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, it sounded like things had really gone downhill.  People complaining about it being filthy, dirty, and the hot dogs being disgusting.  So I was a little nervous when I walked in, but when I did, I found out that it was the same old O, and also that there are a bunch of whiners here on Yelp.\n\nSeriously, whining about having to order your fries from a different counter than your hot dog?  Seriously?  Like someone else said, order your fries, then go get your hot dog (with mustard, relish, and sauerkraut, please!) and then go back and get your fries.  Be sure to get GRAVY with your fries.\n\nHaha, and all the whining about the bathroom.  Seriously?  Did you really think that the bathrooms in that place would be clean?  Seriously?  I've never actually gone down the \"staircase to nowhere\" where the bathrooms are.  At least not that I can remember (i.e. I quite possibly did in a drunken stupor one day.)  Where is the street smarts in kids these days? \n\nOf course it gets crowded at night.  But, if you go in the daytime, there should be no real wait.  Plus, your chances of being the victim of a drive by go WAY down.\n\nY'all SHOULD be up in arms about what's happened AROUND the O.  Zelda's turned into a 5 guys?  WTF?  C.J. Barneys turned into a DUNKIN' DONUTS?  You've got to be f-ing kidding me!\n\nYou go to the O for awesome (but greasy) fries (don't forget the GRAVY!) and decent hot dogs.  The burgers and chicken parm sandwiches are good too.  The pizza has never been good.  But you have to eat O pizza when you're drunk anyway.  You just do.\n\nI guess if you want sterile chain burgers and fries you can just go next door to 5 guys now.  But if you want to be shot at while eating tasty crispy dogs and a mountain of fries with ketchup and gravy cooked in the same grease for the past 50 years, while drinking a 40 of malt liquor, you've got to go to the O.  I guess you either get this place or you don't.
