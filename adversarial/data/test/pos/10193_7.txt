Came here for Tuesday's AYCE shrimp dinner. \nWe received terrible service from our waitress, Brenda. No customer service, no smile whatsoever. \nFirst, she brought out wrong  order to our table so I said that's not what we ordered. She gave us nasty attitude instead of apologizing. Second, I never received fried shrimp and cat fish (comes with my AYCE dinner) so I told her I never got it. She tells me \"You said you don't like catfish.\" NO. I never said that. Why would I say that? \"IF\" I did, what about fried shrimp? Third, I asked her for more shrimp. She just sighed and disappeared. WTH?! She brought out the shrimp giving me a dirty look like she did me a big favor or something. My drink was empty but I didn't bother to ask her for the refill. Fourth, we ordered \"Dried\" no sauce ribs to take out (we made sure and told her twice!), when we got home, we found out it had a lot of spicy sauce on it. Also, we didn't get the side. \nTerrible, terrible, terrible service!!! I looked around to see if it was just us receiving this kind of attitude from her but she had shitty attitude to every table she had. Probably she had a bad day but how could she expect good tips from customers?!\nThe food was OK, but we will not come back to this location.
