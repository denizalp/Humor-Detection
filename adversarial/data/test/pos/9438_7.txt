Open letter to business owners everywhere:\n\nWatch out!  Your dream is in jeopardy.  \n\nAll that you'd hoped for, all that you've worked for, is reliant upon one key factor, over which you have only scant control -- you somehow need to get your hourly wage employees to either believe in your same mission, or at least be able to fake it for the paycheck.  How you do that is part of your undertaking as a small biz owner, but you simply must figure out a way to do it.\n\nIt just won't do to have a super original idea with great potential (such as the delightful SOUNDING Steakenburger idea) ruined by careless execution (such as the ironic twist of having the SHAVED RIBEYE STEAK portion of the conglomeration OVERCOOKED and OVERSEASONED, ie burnt and salty, while the GROUND CHUCK portion is barely even cooked to a state of RARE.  Shouldn't it have been the other way around -- well done ground meat and rare steak -- at least  for food-safety's sake?).\n\nA wonderful thing like 'fresh-cut fries with sea-salt' looks good on paper (or the menu board).  However it's a menu item that's tough to execute well, and a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers did not look so good on my plate, nor taste like much more than a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers.\n\nBusiness owner, I know you can't be everywhere at once, so aside from standing behind them watching at every moment, there must be a way to instill in employees some portion of the excitement you feel about sharing your idea with the world.\nIf you can't inspire a little bit of this quality in them, they won't instill enough quality in your food, no matter how creatively and thoughtfully the menu\/recipe was formed.\n\nSadly, many wonderful dreams have ended when the owner gets a rude wake-up call that their brainchild wasn't nurtured attentively enough.
