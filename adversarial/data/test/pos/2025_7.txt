Finding an auto repair shop that you can trust not only in terms of service and repair quality but in terms of cost and pricing is quite daunting for all of us I think we can agree. I came across Whitey's thanks to twitter and asking around for any auto repair shop recommendations. I was able to ask some questions directly to the GM Scott via twitter, and he might indeed be the only auto guy you'll see tweeting and replying to you and he does so quickly and with a great sense of humor as well. He of course can't produce nor wouldn't try to repair your car over the internet, but he gave me a good idea of what I could expect and after checking out the many reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring in my car in for some repairs.\n\n I'm pretty diligent about getting several quotes from different dealers, and I'm not necessarily one to advocate for going for the lowest price but after calling some of the other reputable shops in the area I was convinced that Whitey's does indeed provide great value. I continue to recommend Whitey's to my friends who are hesitant when it comes to car repairs and finding an \"honest\" place. I'm sure you'll feel the same way when you bring your vehicle there. \n\nIt's never pleasant to have to repair a car but at least I fell that I'm not being overcharged or dealing with inexperienced or pushy people.
