Me and my lady used to come to this spot at least once a month for the amazing sushi. This all changed as of last night as we are currently looking for a new spot. Owner and sushi chef were a little hmmmm let's just say messed up from a tiny bit to much drinking, along comes customer to my left ( we sat in the middle of two different groups at the sushi bar ) drinking and having shots with the head chef, some conversation about where they are from is exchanged and then escalates to the head chef cussing him out taking his shirt off to show his tattoos, which ended up in customer to my right coming out of no where and playing referee for customer and Mr Head Chef who has been in jail and is from LA. Now I'm from LA myself and don't need to hear your story about what part your from or what gang you rolled with when you were younger, years in jail etc.  I don't normally go out of my way to write many reviews and I loved this place for years but if you are thinking about going here I would say try somewhere else !
