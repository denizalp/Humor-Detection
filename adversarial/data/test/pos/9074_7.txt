It's a consistent breakfast chain that offers good food. It's clean & the staff are generally kind.  I always come here when I come back home to visit Ontario or Quebec.\n\nThis time I was disappointed. My staple here is getting a nutella raspberry crepe,I felt like I was shanked when she told me that they no longer offer raspberry as a fruit option\/subsitute. So I had to go with my backup, a mushroom swiss omelette. The potatoes are either a hit or miss & they were perfect this time.\n\nThe prices are ok although I wish it was a little cheaper. I will be back but with much less enthusiam since they took my raspberries away.
