The dining room is repulsive.\n\nI was so turned off by the filth that it completely ruined the experience. Less than halfway in to my 7\" sandwich a cartoon-angel appeared on my shoulder telling me to toss it and run.\n\nI couldn't care less about decor but when everything in sight is dirty, greasy tables, sticky floors, dead bugs and a char caked grill I can't do it. \n\nMind you, I've eaten at street taco stands in Tijuana and felt safer. \n\nHad someone carried out for me I probably would have liked it.
