We ordered the family style dinner and it included 5 entrees, lo mein, egg fried rice and steamed rice for $34.99.  The twice cooked pork, sweet and sour pork and orange chicken were all fried and no vegetables.  These dishes were fantastic however, I didn't realize they do not include veggies so that was a major disappointment.  The chicken chow mein with crispy noodles would have been my favorite however, there was a communication problem when ordering.  I wanted it with chicken, celery, onion and bean sprouts only.  The waitress asked if I wanted bok choy and I said \"yes\".  She then said \"no bean sprouts?\"  So I said \"I want the bean sprouts instead of bok choy if I could only choose just one.\"  When the dish came out it was only chicken and bean sprouts.  Total disappointment!  I then realized that she was trying to say they don't have celery but have bok choy instead.  Chow mein is not chow mein without celery.  I loved the flavor of the sauce the chicken was amazing and the crispy noodles were the best I've had in a long time.  The broccoli beef was great.  The beef was flavorful   tender, and it included plenty of broccoli.  I would order it again.  The lo mein was fantastic and the egg fried and steamed  rice were good.  I see why so many people go here because we got soooooo much food for the price and it was overall good and I would definitely go back however I would order something else that wasn't fried and had veggies. If you like fried food and no veggies and get literally a PILE of food and have a PILE of food to take home with you, then this is the place to go.  Do not try to special order here or you may not get what you are asking for.
