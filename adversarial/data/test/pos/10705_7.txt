I've heard about this place from tv and friends and wanted to check it out and omg I will never ever come back. The servers are dicks but at a point it stopped being funny and just became flat out rude, disrespectful, racist. They made a joke about Mexicans and Home Depot and that was distasteful come on. The food is super expensive! I had a steak with mashed potatoes and water, my sister had a shrimp basket (6shrimps and fries) with water and our bill was $50 are you kidding me? Maybe if the food was as good as wood ranch or Lucile's I wouldn't mind but it was full of grease, the fries were old and the server admitted that to us, my steak was all fat and not steak!! There was no flavor to the food it was disgusting I'd rather eat at Applebee's or even McDonald's then come back here.
