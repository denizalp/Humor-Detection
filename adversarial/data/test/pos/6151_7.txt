This place is simply over rated. We were able to easily get reservations a week in advance, but it looked like a 30-60 mi ute wait if you just walked up. You pay in advance, and they ask for a tip amount. I am so glad that we said we wouldn't top up front but would leave cash on the table. The service was terrible.  When the waitress came to the table the first time she studied the receipt (which the hostess puts on the table). As it is a one price buffet, all I can surmise is she was checking for tip amount. And since she didn't see any it may explain why we almost never saw her. Dishes piled, drinks went unfilled, unless we overtly flagged her down. And we were seated in the VIP section which made it far more egregious. \n\nThe food was meh. Most of it was unlabeled, and no one behind the counter offered any explanation (and there were few behind the counter, even st 9:00 pm). The best food were the crepe station (savory or sweet filled crepes made to order) and the desserts. The crepes were fantastic, as were the macaroons. \n\nThere are far better places to eat on the strip, so I'd skip this one.
