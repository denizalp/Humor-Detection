Took forever and pho usually does not take that long. The place is small and guaranteed you'll walk out of that place with a strong Asian food stuck onto your clothing. Expect to want to shower and wash your clothes after. \n\nCan't split the checks in any way. Not even partial cash and the rest card. So lame. Pho tasted kind of funky...servers always had to be flagged down. Will not be back. I'll take my chances on waiting at pho Kim long.
