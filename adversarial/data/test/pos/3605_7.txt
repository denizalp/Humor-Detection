I'm a nerd and I grew up on comics. There, I said it.\n\nThe stories of Wolverine and the X-Men littered the floor of my parent's house, Batman posters hung in every nook and cranny of my room, I'd play Superman outside with my friends or pretend that my Huffy was actually a roaring Harley and I was Ghost Rider condemning souls to the underworld. Wow, that got dark pretty quickly, but it's the truth! I was a true child of the 90s in that I experienced the Copper Age of comic books in full effect. The resurgence of super heroes was everywhere and I was completely caught up in it just as much as the next kid on the playground. This fascination with the visual medium lasted well into my teenage years until hormones got the best of me and I traded Superboy for Playboy.\n\nIt took me a while to come back to comic books, but when I finally realized that I missed the stories and that they delivered an experience you can't get in films or novels, Comic Oasis was there with open arms to deliver me to the Promised Land. Their staff is patient and knowledgeable and answered every question I had regarding my lapse in reading. My favorite aspect of this shop is the stock, it's packed from floor to ceiling but doesn't seem cluttered or messy at all. Do yourself a favor and check this place out when you're in the area, if I lived on the Northwest side of town, I'd be here every day just to gawk at the statues alone.\n\nAnd yes, although I'm 25 I still wear underwear on the outside of my shorts and play with action figures until the wee hours of the morning. \n\nLadies?
