Came here the other night for a night cap of sweetness.\n\nEven if it's cold in Las Vegas... gelato is great anytime!\n\nLove that their social media post flavors of the day. Different flavors daily make this place a popular spot.\n\nI had their green tea gelato with white chocolate in the mix.\n\nI'll be back for more! :)
