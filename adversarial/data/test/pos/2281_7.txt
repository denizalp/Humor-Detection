I got so sick from eating at the Lifecafe. I have not gotten this sick since more than 20 years ago. No, this is 10x worse.  I think it was contamination of the Ranch dressing and I didn't even use it all. \nI got strep throat, coughing, headache, body ache and worst, laryngitis for 5 days and continuing.\nI'm still sick.\nI spoke to the manager and asked her if other people have complained of getting sick there and she said no.\nJust be warned.
