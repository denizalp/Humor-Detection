I'm gonna begin with saying this review should be a 2, but a couple things saved it.\n\nThe place: Beach themed place with a nice warm inviting feeling inside. The outside was cool, lots of bench starting, fire pits, sand volleyball pit, and a indoor\/outdoor bar. No place I'd wanna be during summer but nights like this are great for outdoor dining.\n\nThe food: we ordered the shack steak tacos.\nOmg the food was NOT good at all. The marinated steak \"faux carne asada\" was most likely round steak with McCormick taco seasoning. \nThe refried pinto beans although supposedly homemade were far from it, Rosarita canned beans if I had to guess, or Walmart brand.\nThe rice...no holding back, the rice was fucked. Dry, undercooked, funny colored, my girlfriend guessed it was like a rice o roni \"authentic Mexican rice\" or some heinous knock off. \n\n\"Three cheese blend\" was Great Value Fiesta mix, I couldn't be anymore convinced of it. \n\nI ALREADY KNOW I'm gonna have the shits tonight #bubblies #percolating #brewing #CandyCrush\n\nWhat saved the review:\nShawntell our server was very very pleasant although she either didn't know the beans were out of a can or sure straight up lied to us. Either way she was great, and the manager came by to check on us and she was nice too.\n\nThe sopapillas for dessert were amazing! They used local honey I'm guessing and it was good. Too good, like sexual good. If I'm honest I was almost slightly aroused while eating them, and my girlfriend commented on other uses for the honey.\n\nThe facts: this place sucked as far as a restaurant goes. Would serve better as a bar. After wasting my \"tacotuesday\" on this place I'm ashamed to admit I actually feel less Mexican after walking out of that place.\n\nThe end
