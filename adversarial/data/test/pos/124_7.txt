Ah.  The buses.\n\nConsidering the size of Pittsburgh, the bus system here is actually pathetic.  I live within a 1\/2 of a mile from 8 bus lines.  Yet, there are plenty of places that I need 2 transfers to get to.  If you don't want to go to Oakland or downtown, the buses just don't get the job done.\n\nFirst, as much as people are saying that there is real-time tracking, this is only half true.  About 1\/4 of the buses have real time tracking, which is only helpful then 25% of the time.  If all of the buses had real-time, I would be willing to give the PAT a 3.5 star review.  The buses are all over the place time wise.\n\nSecond, the buses are dirty and over-crowded.  Clearly there is a decent demand for the buses in the city.  So why not actually make a decent public transportation system?  Many buses only run in rush hour or once per hour.  The T is a bit cleaner and significantly more reliable, however.\n\nFinally,drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude.  However, any time I have had a problem on the bus (because the biggest creeps ride the bus), the drivers have mostly been helpful.  One, quite literally, threw a guy off of the bus for me.  On the other hand, some drivers will refuse to make stops if they are running behind schedule.\n\nSince I am a student, I use the bus constantly, thanks to it being free.  I wouldn't pay to use the bus.  And speaking of paying, no one understands how the system works, so don't worry.  It varies bus by bus, time of day, and more.
