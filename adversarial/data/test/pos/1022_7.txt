The power of Yelp compels you. As Jennifer noted in her review, you might pass this obscure dumpling house every day of your life and never have noticed it. But search Yelp for dumplings in Scarborough and you'll turn up this sucker and amazingly a couple people have reviewed it.\n\nBy 7 pm Saturday this place fills up (don't let Jennifer's typical empty restaurant photo fool you) with a mix of Chinese and Koreans (based on a visual sampling of the newspapers patrons were reading). A sure sign. I was the only honkey (\"ko jang eee\"[1]) in the place but my lone arrival caused the staff no consternation, hand wringing, or sucking of air through the teeth. Everyone seemed to speak good English. \n\nThe menu is in English (with typically overtly literal translations) and Chinese. Despite being Koreanized Chinese food and Sinotophied Korean food, there was no Korean on the menu. The menu offers a good range of dumplings. Interestingly prices can be very deceiving (in a good way) and the uninitiated might tend to over order as prices are incredibly low. As Jennifer notes, you get over a dozen over-stuffed dumplings for $5. \n\nThe kimchi fried rice (kimchi bokumbap) was pretty sub par. Jennifer noted while we planned this impromptu 2 person \"Elder Statesmen of Yelp\" UYE  that Koreans do weird things to Chinese food but I'll offer Chinese do weird things, and little justice, to some basic signature Korean dishes. Avoid this one (ie the kimchi fried rice... NOT the restaurant) for sure. However, they do up the cold buckwheat noodle soup (neng myun) right. Korean Chinese or Chinese Koreans tend to hail from the North Korean border region and this soup is a signature dish from that region. Like the massive bamboo steamer of dumplings, the soup came out in a huge bowl with enough for three and also rang in at about $5.\n\nService was quick. Food came out with little delay. And table service seemed to avoid Korean service rules (if you want something, flag your waiter down, otherwise it's assumed everything is copacetic).\n\nReally, if you want to fill two people quickly and cheaply, Dumpling Village is your oppa. Damage was $21 with tax and tip and food packed up to go (\"kudurap da restup\" [2])\n\n------------\n\n[1] Korean slang for whitey... meaning \"big nose\".\n[2] Korean for doggy bag.
