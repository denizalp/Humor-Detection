Truly awful service. We (two of us) waited at their entrance (we were the only people in line) for close to 20 minutes without even a word being said to us. Can't imagine the food being any good if the service is this appalling. The server and bar men saw us waiting to get seated (or atleast spoken to) and yet no one moved a muscle. After 20 minutes, we left. And they saw us leave. And again, nothing. \n\nNever going back !!
