It's so funny to think that many moons ago when we use to live downtown, we would only go to Spadina Chinatown.  Being new immigrants to Canada, we had absolutely no interests in anything else that wasn't Chinese.  Dang I had such a depraved childhood!  There are sooo many great gems in the Kensington Market, that every time we are downtown we always try to go here instead of Chinatown so the roles have been reversed:)\n\nEmporium Latino is such a great all in one store.  They sell a variety of Latino products such as authentic sauces, taco and tortilla shells, spices and peppers and even fried pork rinds!  But most people seem to be most attracted by their hot food area.  Serving a variety of Latino favourites such as pupusas, tamales, tostadas and tacos, the food here is authentic and homely.  Stuff you would probably find in a Latin American home.  We had the soup of the day (beef) and it was outstanding!  With big chunks of beef, tomatillos, carrots and cabbage, it's food that a Latin grandma would have made.\n\nThe store is a bit weird in that the seating area is part of a converted garage and you have to walk up the stairs to order.  Food took a bit long to get but was made to order and service was very friendly.\n\nOverall a great place for Latino food in the Kensington Market!\n\n4.5\/5!
