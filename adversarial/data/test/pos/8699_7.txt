Fitzgeralds on Fremont street is a difficult hotel and casino to review.\n\nOn one hand it has an overall dingy impression, staffed by people who look like they have been in Vegas for decades. \nOn the other hand, the rooms are inexpensive, clean and nice.\nThe staff is actually  very accommodating to your needs. \nSometimes I wonder about the demeanor of the staff and think maybe they look the way they do because of all the \"dingbat\" people who frequent this casino. \nIt is a nice, inexpensive place to stay - again rooms are very nice, not spacious, but nice. \nNice Hotel - poor casino......................\nIt is just not so great a place for entertainment, or eating. \nIt seems to me that the management throws in a few \"food places,\" \"bars,\" and a small room with \"entertainment\" as an afterthought to the casino action.\nThey for sure, do not use them to draw in gamblers to the casino.\n\nOne of the very best things about Fitzgeralds is driving in the parking garage. Or should I say the parking box  ......\nIt is the exact opposite of the large parking ( spacious) garages located on the strip ...... Mandalay Bay, Mirage ..... etc.\nIt is small, with narrow quick turns and is very steep. \nYou have to make it to the 6th floor of the garage to find public parking.\nThat converts to 5 floors of triple hairpin turns.\nUnparalleled excietment  !  !  !\n\nThey could run an event like the Pikes Peak Hill Climb, called the Fitz Garage Bash and give prizes to the cars that make it to the top in the quickest time.................. it would be a great event    ....... much better than the \"dingy casino.\"\n\nMaybe a good scrub would help this casino - because the rooms make it a nice place to stay.
