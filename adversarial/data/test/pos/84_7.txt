There are times when one just wants to curl up in fetal position, in pajamas, parked in front of a tv on a cold and blustery day.  But then you realize \"Oh, wait it's Monday and I have to work on this crappy day.\"  Once 12:00 PM hits, I know that my crappy day is going to get slightly better because of Pho Thang. Minh Anh is still my favorite place to go for Pho, however Pho Thang is right across the street from the building I work at.  I could go to Saigon, which is also walking distance from me, but I think Pho Thang's Pho is much better and cheaper, especially if you get their combos. I always get carry out, which might be best if you do not have a lot of time for lunch.  Sometimes, the service is a little slow during lunch rush, but that is expected. I will always go to Pho Thang for my Pho when I am at work and want that cozy feeling of being curled up on a couch with my pajamas.
