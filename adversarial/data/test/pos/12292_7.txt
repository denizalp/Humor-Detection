I am a movie WHORE. I've rated 2500 movies on Netflix. I used to wait in line for the midnight premieres. Camelview holds some very special memories for me. if it's sheik but not on the AMC, daddy warbucks studio fatheads' approved list, it might get a chance at the Camelview. Now of course we have Netflix, but some of those jewels deserve a proper screen. Thanks to Dan for making it happen.\n\nEnchanted April\nMuch Ado About Nothing (saw it about 40 times in the theater)\nThe Joy Luck Club\nPi\nAmelie\nMadness of King George\nRemains of the Day\n\nCounter service is sketchy, but as the years go by, so come and go the pimply teens on their first jobs. Now if only we can break the ratings board. If you haven't seen it, check Unrated.
