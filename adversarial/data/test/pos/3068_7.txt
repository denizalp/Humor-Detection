They've only been open a few weeks, but Kitchen 18 is already doing a fabulous job with their (kosher) food, service, and ambiance.  \n\nI went to meet some girlfriends for dinner the other night, and we all were delighted to see that the place was jammed.  Lucky for us, there was one table open when we arrived, and it seemed to have our name on it!  The hostess was friendly as was our server, and we were impressed by the wide selection on the menu.  None of us keep kosher, but we were intrigued that there were plenty of fresh and healthy options.  \n\nWe started with the hummus appetizer to share and we also tried the salami and fig bruschetta.  The hummus was a tad on the bland side, but I loved that they served it with warm fluffy pita (white and wheat) and delicious pickles and peppers too.  The bruschetta was tasty... I can't compare it to Postino (my fave place for bruschetta) as you can't possibly compare kosher salami bruschetta to something quite the opposite, but it was good.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the Israeli salad with schwarma and really enjoyed it.  It was a large portion, so I boxed half of it to take home, but it was colorful, filling, and seasoned just right. One of my friends had the sliders and the other went with steak, which they both enjoyed.  Oh, and I ate more than a few of the sweet potato fries that came with the steak - they were delicious!\n\nWe shared a tiramisu dessert which didn't disappoint, even being dairy free!  (The kitchen happens to be entirely dairy free, so don't ask for a cheese burger when you go!)\n\nI love that the attached market stays open late, so I did a little bit of shopping after our meal.  I highly recommend a product they carry called \"popcorners.\"  They are popped corn chips and totally addicting!  There are tons of other unique kosher food items at the market too and an entire jewish gift shop as well (which I believe is in the process of being remodeled).\n\nI look forward to returning to Kitchen 18 again soon... It's moderately priced and conveniently located on the Southeast corner of Scottsdale and Shea.  Whether you're keeping kosher, trying to eat healthy, or none of the above, there is something for everyone on the menu.
