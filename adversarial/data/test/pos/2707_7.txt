i went here with a couple of girlfriends for a 'girls night' dinner. solid place for a date night dinner. the ambiance is loungy and relaxing, lowly lit, and comfy. it is also the kind of place that you take someone that you want to impress but not have to drop too much cash like you would at other \"new american\" restaurants in the area. \n\ni liked the entree options (ribs, scallops, tuna, and quite a few pork dishes) and also was intrigued by the cocktail selection. looks like they have a lot of unique cocktails that would be great to try. i had the tuna and it was prepared perfectly medium rare. i loved the avocado tzatziki that came with it. it was light and airy but had a lot of flavor. i only wish there was more of it on the plate.\n\ni think the service was the only less than stellar thing at this place. while our waiter was nice, he wasn't really all that attentive and only came back once to refill drinks\/take drink orders. we also wanted to check out dessert but unfortunately he forgot to bring the dessert menu and just brought us our check.\n\nit was busy even on a Monday so i would definitely get reservations if you'd like to check this place out. i may be back for a little happy hour cocktail exploration but not too sure about a full dining experience again.
