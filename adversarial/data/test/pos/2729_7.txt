The Gladstone is wild. There are any number of fun avenues to traverse in this hep and modern community hub and hotel. There's the Melody Bar which serves as a sinister spot for meetups, tweetups and other shindigs. Cover is usually free, and there are a wide swath of events from live music to arty gatherings to their well-known Karaoke nights.\n\nThen there's the café, which is a full service restaurant during the week, and I believe attaches to the ballroom during weekends. All the food is locally sourced and pretty damned tasty. I've grabbed lunch a few times, and I would recommend the cubano: a pressed roast pork sandwich, with bacon and mustard. Mikey (i.e., me) likes it.\n\nI've also visited for a few community events which are often hosted in the spacious ballroom or the gallery upstairs. The over 100-year-old venue makes it a charming spot for such soirées. Be sure to take the stairs as the elevator is slower than molasses in January during a coldspell under the guidance of a well-meaning turtle.\n\nThen there's the hotel, where I've never stayed and as a native Torontonian probably never will. That said, there is much to see and do at the Gladstone. An amazing spot.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Let he who is GLAD cast the first STONE.\n\nMenu Readability: Art design at this place is definitely a forte.\n\nNeed to mention: This place is pretty much the catalyst for the redevelopment of West Queen West. Respect.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Yeah, sometimes I go by Mikey. Other aliases: Laslo Kovacs, Buster H., Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc, et. al.
