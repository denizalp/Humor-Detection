I've been fatting down at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop ever since I set up camp in Las Vegas almost two years ago. Why do I keep returning, you ask? Because I consistently get a good sandwich without the awkward salad-tossing mongoloid named Jared.\n\nThe meat, vegetables, bread, and just about everything is PERFECT at Capriotti's. Even the service. The ONLY areas that keep them from a perfect rating is price and lack of side dishes. While I understand that I am reviewing a sandwich shop, it frustrates the hell out of me that you can't get a single side dish. ESPECIALLY when you already have stuffing and cranberry sauce (from the Bobbie) and coleslaw (SlawBeJo) for the sandwiches.\n\nCapriotti's Sandwich Shop has a massive variety of just about anything you can put between buns (Take those nasty thoughts to the strip, people). With a great selection for EVERYONE, from us normal humans to you tree-humping vegetarians, there is a sexy sandwich waiting for YOU at Capriotti's!\n\nPS - One important thing to note about Capriotti's is that the sandwiches\/subs\/whatever-the-hell-you-get are almost as good the second and third day (due to the greatness of the bread). Take notes, Scrubway.
