This is the life and i might have just realized it's right before my eyes. \n\nAfter reading the negative reviews and a few salient 5 star reviews I can surmise this: This is NW west coffee done in the desert. Get used to it!\n\nI lived in Portland OR and was fueled by Stumptown coffee. Four Barrel is its little cousin, or are they sisters? Competitive brothers? Anyway, it is artisan coffee with emphasis on the process, product and passion. If we could just purge the syrups, fraps and button pressing espresso we would find the coffee gods smiling upon GC.\n\nGiant Coffee have beans, dark...flavorful...hard...b e a n s.    ... anyway, got lost there for a bit. Flag me.\n\nThe only real difference between Giant and most NW roasters\/cafes is the service. \n\nIn NW, it is kind of lik this: \"Uh you came here to get coffee, you should be lucky we are even making you this awesome espresso and allowing you to drink our art in a cup.... Andddd you still have not ordered. Know what you want before you speak to me.\"\n\nIn Giant, \" HEY! Lets talk about what you want to talk about, oh you are here for great tasting coffee? I thought we could Socratic method for about 30min?\"\n\nI personally dont mind the friendly dispositions, it is refreshing to have a little playful banter with my coffee. Everybody is fighting their own battles, and someone saying have a great day after a single serving convo is worth paying 23cents more than going to Starbucks for a drip.\n\nThis is the life and i might have just realized it's right before my eyes...yep.\n\nRL\n\nNOte: If the owner or manager doesn't respect the customer, that is always a no in the world of business. No matter where you go in the world, you can never escape douche bags costumers. Get used to it, and make it opportunity.
