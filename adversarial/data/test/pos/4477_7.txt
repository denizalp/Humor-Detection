Mellow Mushroom is finally in Phoenix.  They're up on Happy Valley Rd. on the NE corner of I-17 and Happy Valley, in that Norterra shopping area.  It faces Happy Valley, so it's easy to find.\n\nTheir specialty is pizza with fresh & premium ingredients, somewhat similar to California Pizza Kitchen.  The crust on my pizza today was moist and chewy on the inside with a tad of crispness on the outside.  Sauce had a \"bright\" sweet tomato flavor, and the cheese was very thick and chewy - almost as if I had ordered extra cheese on the pie.  Pretzels were very good too, very chewy like the ones you see in the mall vs. the traditional German variety.\n\nGreat selection of beers (35 taps) and happy hour at 3pm.  So, if you're happy, find yourself at happy hour on Happy Valley Road - then why not have a pint of ale and a fresh pizza at Mellow Mushroom?
