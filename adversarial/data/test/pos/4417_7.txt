If I could eat seafood every day for the rest of my life I would die happy, so I am always looking for new seafood places to try.  \n\nBeing a landlocked desert state known for their Mexican food it is hard to find a seafood place that I am able to find the courage to try.  The crab cakes were outstanding and the ambience just added to the experience.\n\nI had the Ahi tuna which was good and my girlfriend had the swordfish which was great!  \n\nThe place is in a hip area of Scottsdale and the only negative part of the evening was when the Manager came up to greet us at our table I found out it was my girlfriend's ex boyfriend.  Probably wont go on any more dates there but definitely want to go back and try happy hour...maybe with my brother.
