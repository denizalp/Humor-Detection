I love the LAS terminal because it has free wifi and shops I actually like to go to.  It also has a train that takes you to terminal 3 to go back home to Hawaii instead of having to walk far, especially after clocking 9 miles a day for shopping and cruising the strip.  I wish the Honolulu airport had this option.  I like the setup of having a car rental center that is close by and shuttles you to your desired airline. \n\nTSA was a lot quicker here than at home, but not as polite.  They had the cool body surface scanners but it didn't like my underwire bra and I had to get a body search.  \n\nTerminal 3 has a Starbucks and a snack stand which is extremely helpful when you have an early morning flight. Prices are pretty high but I had no choice.  There are also last minute slot machines you can hit up before leaving.\n\nSpeaking of the train\/metro, it is pretty fast and the wait for it to come is minimal, so I don't understand why people still run to catch it like its the last one of they day.  One particular passenger ran in while the doors were closing, then held it open for five of his able bodied friends to stroll in on their own time, then proceeds to loudly claim that he \"took it for the team\" when he got hit by the closing doors.  I was kind of fed up with the mainland attitude after being in California and Nevada for only a week and I was ready to go home to Hawaii where there is still some 'aloha spirit'.   A fellow passenger asked him 'what team' did he take it for and he responded the 'airport people team'.  Yah ok, I hope you're not on the flight home with me, buddy, because I'm not into inconveniencing others for my selfish purpose.  Bye LV I will be back!
