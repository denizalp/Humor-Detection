They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.\n\nRegarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.\n\nSpring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.\n\nMy date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.\n\nThe owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.
