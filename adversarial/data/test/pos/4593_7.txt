Why do people go to Olive Garden?  Why did i go here today?\nSimple answer: with force.  \nI HAD to go where a member of the family chose to go.  I haven't eaten here in about 8 years.  Many reasons which were confirmed tonight.\nPasta was mushy. The \"famous\" salad actually had decent flavor but was drenched in dressing.  Breadsticks were a bit hard and tasted like buttered white bread.  Fish was breaded but okay tasting.  Pizza was not so good. Didn't like the cheese.  To sum up the whole meal: it was like heating up a \"t.v. dinner.\"
