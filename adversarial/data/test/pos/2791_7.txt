Sweet Wife scouts for a cool restaurant on Yelp and announces, \"I want to go to Kotex\".\n\n*Record scratching*\n\n\"Whaat?\"\n\n\n\nThere was only one waitress so she was pretty frantic but the tacos were amazing. Deliciously flavorful. And the torta was severed on a perfectly toasted bun. We got one taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla. That was a fresh, crispy little surprise. The nachos and burrito at the table next to us looked so good that I almost asked for a bite.\n\nWe've got a new must-go in Vegas.\n\nNow what was the name again? Tampax? Always?
