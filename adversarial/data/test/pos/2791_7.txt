Shop is currently owned and operated by Yanbing Chen, of Cleveland Violins fame. \nBow rehair quality is better than ever, and Yanbing always has a few interesting violins\/violas\/cellos for sale as well as an array of wooden and synthetic bows. His rentals seem like a great value, too.\n\nDesert Strings is the premier shop in Vegas for fiddle and bow service. The proof is in the finished product. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fos9yZpICV0
