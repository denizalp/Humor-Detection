I knew about Fat Choy back when they were known as Great Bao so it's nice to know that they've upgraded to a full restaurant now instead of being a pop-up in a beauty salon.  I came by for lunch and decided to try their bao and see what the hype was all about.\n\nYou get two bao for one order and lucky for me they were nice enough to let me mix and match the pork and duck baos with one order.\nPeking Duck Bao with cucumber, scallions, and hoisin sauce -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/Z3btzg\nPork Belly Bao with pickled mustard greens, cilantro, and crushed peanuts --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/11ds7IZ\nBoth were awesome, but I think I liked the duck the best.  \n\nI also ordered the Sesame Noodles which was very good as well if you're into cold noodles.\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/11drRK0\n\nThe menu is pretty affordable and extensive ranging from burgers and fries to rice bowls and other noodle dishes and there were quite a few other menu items that I wanted to try.  I'm definitely coming back again for the Shrimp Toast and the Fat Choy Burger.  Give Fat Choy a try if you want some awesome Asian comfort food!
