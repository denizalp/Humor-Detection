If you're hungry, don't go here. The food is bland. Fianc√©e states he had had more flavor in frozen taquitos and this reminded him of a TV dinner. There is a huge staff (overwhelming to be honest) that constantly refilled waters etc (which is nice) but the food was bland, VERY small (even for share plates). We are big foodies and this place we will NEVER return to. Not impressed.
