Due to many stories, arrived before 6pm to avoid the long lineup. The hostess was welcoming and helpful. The servers were nice and knowledgable, they gave realistic suggestions and warned customers who ordered more than average. Once seated, there's a plastic bib with different outfit designs, a pair of plastic gloves and a roll of paper towel.\n\nThe seafood came out piping hot and it felt fresh. The servers repeat the order while dropping off the plastic bag of goods. Ordered the first 3lbs of seafood (crawfish, mussels, clams) in mild and that was more spice than expected. Was excited they had crawfish as many people had said its a seasonal item or sold out early. Had to order another lbs of shrimp not spicy at the end. Chose captain boil's flavour was packed full of butter and garlic (on a date: bring gum). One pair of gloves was definitely not enough as the claws of the crawfish kept ripping the fingers. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience, a bit on the pricey side and lacks variety. Maybe a place to come back on a special occasion.
