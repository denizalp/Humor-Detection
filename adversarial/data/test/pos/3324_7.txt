Don't you just hate it when...\nEverything ends up being smoke and mirrors.\n\nLet me explain....\nPeople need to stop writing reviews if they have never attended or have just visited, It's giving potential students the wrong idea.\nYou will regret attending. \nThis school's career services are a joke. \nThe legit teachers on current projects do a better job of helping students with jobs after they graduate. \nThe people are awesome, yes. Faculty and students alike. Great friends but the schooling and amount of relevant educational material is pathetic, no matter how hard you work at trying to be involved and a part of the school, the services and support UAT \"provides\" falls short of industry standards. \nThis isn't a college it's like a second version of High School.\nHalf of my friends transferred to other colleges, a handful (including myself) pushed through and stuck it out because we were too far in) and ALL of the people I know that have attended have regretted it. If they let the Alumni forums combine with the Incoming students, you'd see for yourself all the stories people are telling of their time here. They'd never do that though for fear of losing potential students. \nIt's all smoke and mirrors and it kills me when I see kids walking in for that tour, \"ooh look shiny things and video games!\" That's great and all but it does not prepare you for your future.\nI wish I could get my money back, I'd even give back the degree if I had to...it's that bad and not worth the time here.\nFor the price you're paying, you can do better I promise you.\nUnfortunately UAT has been not only the biggest regret of my life but of other's lives as well.
