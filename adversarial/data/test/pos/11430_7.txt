MGM offers the quintessential Vegas Strip hotel experience. You can see every type of person here, and there are plenty of food and drink options. It definitely feels like a huge hotel, and it would be quite easy never to leave, but if you want lots of things in one place, MGM is a great choice.\n\nOther pluses include being able to walk right into the monorail station and being close to the legendary lazy river.\n\nThe gym was amazingly packed in the mornings, and 3 of the 15 treadmills were broken. Not the best gym experience, but if you're strategic with timing, you can get every type of machine you want.\n\nRoom was fine - no complaints or issues, but our room wasn't particularly memorable, either. (Try to stay in the main towers, not the west wing, which has smaller rooms - albeit possibly cheaper.)
