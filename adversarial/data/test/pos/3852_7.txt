***************************** 1,028 *******************************\n\n     It was still CES 2014, Andrea's was 1 of the restaurant that my customer's held a happy hour here. Our team came in and stayed back for dinner at bar. \n\n     Andrea's is such a lovely place, swanky, modern, and so chic. The new hot dining spot in Las Vegas is Andrea's at Encore Hotel. Music popping, live DJs provide the night's soundtrack  and the LED displace with Andy Warhol art, the eyes continues changing colorful. The spacious 2 levels dining room, with booths on the side and more than 30 sits at the bar area, a little bit for everyone. \n\n     Chef Joseph Elevado combines hip Asian dining with a sexy atmosphere. Chef Elevado's menu features Wagyu beef and lobster roll, rock shrimp tempura, and NY Strip Steak with Wasabi demi glacé.\n\n- Delicious grilled calamari salad, off-the-menu, ordered by a nice bartender that was serving us.\n\n- SHISHITO PEPPERS mustard miso and CUCUMBER Sunomono salad were both good. \n\n- SEARED ALBACORE SASHIMI crispy onions, ponzu - The albacore was nice but was hidden under the pile of crispy onion. It was so overpowering for us. \n\n- Uni, Otoro were over priced compare to other sushi places in Vegas, and trust me, I've been to plenty.\n\n- BAKED KING CRAB HAND ROLL soy paper, sweet mayo -  this was quite pleasant, tiny roll like my 2 fingers together, but surely worth $18. MUST ORDER\n\n- HAMACHI SASHIMI* crispy garlic, pickled cherry pepper, cilantro, sudachi soy - this was good. $20\n\n- SCALLOP SASHIMI parsley salsa verde $20 this was very nice, MUST TRY\n\n- KIMCHEE, EDAMAME + TOFU FRIED RICE - love it\n\n- SHRIMP AND PORK SHUMAI DUMPLINGS - this was surprisingly good. \n\n- TUNA AND CRISPY RICE* pickled jalapeño, spicy mayo, kecap manis - this was OK $24\n\n      The cocktails menu was very creative, pricey but well worth it to try. You got to slide through the iPad menu to see the picture of the cocktail before you order it, I like that. The wine list was impressive and wines by the glasses were reasonable. COCKTAIL: Mango sashimi cocktail is a MUST ORDER after dinner. \n\n     Our bartender was very attentive even though it was so busy that day during CES 2014.  The food was good but not as exceptional as other sushi that I've been to in Las Vegas, but still 1 of my top Asian Fusion food spots in Vegas. However, I love the ambiance, the drinks, and the whole vibe here. It's such a perfect spot for a large group to dine in or late night dining here on the weekend with live DJs.
