Waste of money. Cover charge was 25. Drinks were 10 for a small plastic cup that was watered down. If there was even liquor in it I'd be shocked. The screaming females were ear piercing annoying. Most of the guys were actually hot but none of them bothered chatting. Save your money and just go to a bar. If you do go, pre-game.
