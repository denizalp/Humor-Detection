Vegas! Do you REALLY need a 5 star hotel to stay in? Do you REALLY need to pay oodles of cash to lay your head considering you'll be spending most of your time not in your room, but out and about and probably getting yourself into some sort of  \"mischief\". \n\nBally's is one of the \"older\" hotels that's located in the middle of strip. So, if you're the type to hoof it, this hotel's location will suit you just fine. \n\nConsidering the room was comped (thanks D-Block), I don't know how much we paid, but for the price of free, ninety free, it was perfect. The basic rooms are just that, basic. It reminded me a lot like Best Western's or Motel 6's I've stayed at before. So, if you don't mind that kind of decor, then I don't see a problem staying here. If you're more for the modern decor, glitzier bathrooms, the other, more modern hotels would be a wiser choice.\n\nOverall, the rooms were good for what they were (considering we probably we only in them for 10 hours of the entire weekend). This is the kind of hotel I would go with my friends and not worry about trying to \"wow\" them. So if you want to have more of a blast spending your money on gambling, clubs, and alcohol, book here and save yourself some change and use it towards fun!
