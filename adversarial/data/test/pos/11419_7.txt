We went there a couple of times, the first time was ok. Nothing impressive. But today the experience was horrible. We arrived at 2.50 after sitting down the manager tells us that the last call is at 3.20. Well if you have a last call don't let people in after 2! We thought we had enough time to order but the waitress comes back at 3 and tells us the last call is in 5 min! \nThe food was rushed in a suspicious way, the salmon tasted old and looked unappealing. From what we saw we think they leave the fresh items for the dinner menu. \nWe are not coming back.
