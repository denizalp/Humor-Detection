The competition for seafood boils is heating up near Vaughan Mills, first with the opening of Boiling Harbour and now with Captain's Boil. Captain's Boil is located next to Yang's Teppanyaki, for those like me who circle around trying to find this place.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and the mussels in garlic sauce. It didn't take too long for the piping hot food to arrive. Both the shrimp and the mussels were tasty, pretty much the same size as at Boiling Harbour. However, I liked the flavor of the sauce more at the Captain's Boil. It's less oily. There is definitely less sauce here than at Boiling Harbour, which is great if you don't want to drench your gloves in the sauce, but not great if you enjoy drinking the sauce. You're not provided with a bucket for shells, but asked to leave them on the table. I found that to be unpleasant.\n\nThe wait staff was super attentive. I was able to get water refills regularly. They kept asking if I needed anything and how things were going, to the point that a number of them asked one right after the other.
