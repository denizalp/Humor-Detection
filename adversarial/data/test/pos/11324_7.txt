As we are avid practicing pescaterians, we had to try this new spot out.  We arrived at an early dining hour, doing so helped avoid the Saturday crowd as when we left around 6:30, the line was already wrapped around the waiting patio. Our server was a very attentive considerate fellow, there to please and always had a smile from ear to ear. \n\nAs many patrons noted, the trifecta sauce is indeed the best initial option however I too felt the level 2 was spicier than a 2 should be. Also be careful as you should let the food cool off a bit as it literally is still too hot to the touch upon arrival.\n\nThe menu is only orderable by the pound, no ounces, no piece meal, so come hungry. Hubby was dying for a taste of the ocean and altho being in the desert gives him paranoia for raw oysters, his half dozen choice was the best of the night. Too bad we ordered other items or he would have had an all you can eat half shell affair, yah that good, small and not Kumamoto size but perfect for beggars and not choosers. So good he had to try the fried ones too despite already being too stuffed!\n\nThe shrimp and snow crab came with utensils and we thoroughly were almost elbow deep in the sauce by the end of the meal. Don't worry bibs are included with your meal and a dining room sink is available for frequent visits. There are a plethora of sides to choose but the Cajun fries were best, however word of advice don't neglect them as cold fries are not anyone's friend.\n\nNothing but props to the owners, everything we ordered was hot fresh and on point. Seasonally we missed out on the blue crab and crawfish but the menu boasts nothing but excellent options to satisfy our shellfish desires.  We'll be back and will bring friends soon!
