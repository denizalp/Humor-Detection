With some of the best BBQ food in the GTA, Cafe de Khan is exactly the Pakistani restaurant that Mississauga has been lacking for quite some time now.\n\nWhile i was born in Canada, my family was born and raised in Pakistan.  We rarely look forward to going out for Pakistani food...i mean why would you go out when you can make better at home right?  WRONG!!!\n\nWhile some of their other menu options like their butter chicken were nothing to rave about, the kebabs here may quite possibly change your life!  In all honesty, pretty much everything we've tried off the grill has been worth bragging about.  I highly recommend the kebabs (ground beef skewers), the bihari boti (BBQ beef cubes - tender to the point that they will melt in your mouth), chicken tikka, and the matka ghost (lamb cooked in a clay pot with fresh herbs...a must try!).\n\nWhat really differentiates this place from all others is their bread options.  While their naan is fresh out of their in-house tandoor (never frozen...made fresh to order and fantastic!), the parathas are superb with anything off the grill.  Parathas are like fried tortillas...thin, soft, buttered to death and sooo tasty that you know your stomach will hurt for the rest of the day.  While i recommend the parathas for things off the grill, i also recommend getting a couple naans if you are in a large group or particularly with any dish that has a gravy or is stew like (ie. not off the grill).  \n\nWith a genuinely nice owner, a clean environment, and great prices for such superb food...Cafe de Khan is the reason you want to pack your bags and make the road trip to heartland!  \n\nplease note: all food prepared here is certified halal.
