So a friends club was having their 1st pool party of the year and she has pool parties before at different locations so I was excited to go, looked up the address and saw it was at the Days Inn on camelback and it had only 1.5 star rating on Yelp, so I was thinking man what did I get myself into.\n\nSome girlfriends checked in for the night, got a room for 49 bucks, so went up to their room, it was in the 1st building on 2nd floor, it was an ok room, not the worst I have seen, carpet was old, but I guess the entire hotel (motel?) is being remodeled, so appearances might change right?  Thought it was funny that the picture hanging on the wall by the beds was the exact same picture on the side wall next to it.  \n\nSo my hopes for this pool party were starting to fade, the hotel (motel) just looks dated, and its not its fault, Phoenix just has newer stuff in the area. Just was thinking this is gonna be some rinke-dinke pool.  So friends and I were headed to the pool party, it started at 8pm and we were ready!\n\nOh was I in for a pleasant surprise, between the 2 buildings is this desert oasis,  it seems they have spent time remodeling the pool area, there was a bar , plenty of seating, tables, lounge chairs, nice big clean beautiful pool, good size hot tub.  Friend had a dj spinning some tracks, man this was a great spot for a pool party and glad I didn't bounce when I 1st pulled up! \n\nNot to sure if I would stay overnight yet, I'm prissy and I'm ok with being that lol so lets just see how the remodeling goes! But I will be back at the next pool party forsure!  Pool party gets 5 stars,  but the room is a 3.
