There isn't a Primanti Bros. in NY and with everyone in Pittsburgh praising their food (and me loving food), I had to give this place a try. When you enter, you're welcomed with a more \"at home\", relaxed vibe than say an Applebee's or Outback Steakhouse. It's spacious and doesn't feel cramped. Dress code...what dress code? Just come as comfortable as you'd like. :) Perfect for families or super cool and friendly dates.  Although I didn't dine in and opted rather for takeout - I was given a full dose of in-house service. If it's a particular busy day, be prepared to sort of awkwardly wait at the front entrance until someone sees you. For me, once that happened, everything else was pretty much smooth sailing. Service was efficient and friendly. Order was for the chicken club sandwich and fries, 9 inch pizza, and pecan pie.  :) When we reached back to the hotel, I understood why so many people go bonkers for this place. First, portion. Huge, huge portions. Secondly, taste. Not overly seasoned but packs enough punch to leave you incredibly full and satisfied. Pricing seemed reasonable and along with the service we received, worth it. They don't skimp on any ingredients either. Everything was full and brimming over. Will definitely try this place.
