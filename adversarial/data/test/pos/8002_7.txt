I'm a bit embarrassed to be the first person to give Fritou a not so great review, but . . . I live pretty close to Fritou, they like to stick their signs in my condo's lawn areas. I checked them out on Yelp to see people were pretty happy with their experiences there.\nMine began with being barely greeted by someone who looked like they hated their job. \nIt is dingy, but that's not a big deal to me. Some of the best places to eat look like they have the potential to give you food poisoning.\nNo, my beef is with the soggy, bland fries and extremely greasy chicken I ended up taking home. \nDidn't even finish it.\nAlso tore out the signs on my lawn. . . Don't think they were allowed to do that without asking the condo board to put them up in the first place.
