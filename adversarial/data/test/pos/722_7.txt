'Doh!  I thought I was gonna be the first to review, for sure.  Guess not.  Went here before catching a flight and needed our food fast, no problem!  We each ordered a beer.  The strange thing is that she ordered her michoada style and it had tomato juice in it.  She reassured me this is normal for a certain kind of michoada but I think tomato juice wasn't made to be combined with beer.  Vodka?  Absolutely!! Beer? Nope.\nI got the tostada and the gf got the fajitas.  Both carne asada, gracias.  Anyway, my tostada was tasty.  I forgot to ask how her fajitas were.  We were in and out in 20 minutes.  \nOne curious thing is that they have a poster on a wall in the bar explaining how many cocktails you can order at a time.  For example, as one person, I could only ordered two.  But with my gf, we could have ordered 5.  Good to know!
