It's that time of the year again-- car registration renewal!\n\nThe minute I see that little postcard telling me that I need to get a smog check and spend my day at the DMV, just ruins my day. Ugh.\n\nIt just so happened that in the same stack of mail, I also saw a mailer for Express Smog. The special rate was $16.99 versus the original price of $19.99. I decided to wake up early on Saturday. Well after a relaxing breakfast and doing some laundry, getting an early start at the smog place turned into noon. Doh! I was stressing out that I was going to run out of time and not make it to the DMV by the end of the day. \n\nI arrived at Express Smog (located in front of Qdoba in the Walmart shopping center) and saw a line about three cars deep. I waited patiently in the AC of my car until they were ready for me to pull up. They took my DMV paperwork and my coupon. My car was done in under 10 minutes! Afterwards, he handed me the paperwork and I was on my way. The guy working there overheard that I was heading over to the DMV to get my tags and said that he could do the registration for me for $10. I started thinking about how difficult it is to find parking at the Stephanie DMV and decided to just do it here for $10 to save my sanity. Literally two minutes later, he gave me all of my receipts and told me that my sticker should be in the mail. Yay! I usually stand in line waiting at AAA for my registration longer than I did here at Express Smog.\n\nAdulting can be difficult, especially if that means waking up and doing something responsible on a Saturday morning but Express Smog makes it so easy! That yearly smog test and my car registration renewal in less than 20 minutes-- sweet deal! Thanks Express Smog, I will see you guys next year!
