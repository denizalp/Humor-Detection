Crazy ass long lines and three people working. Rent from another company.\n\nI travel fairly often for work - and vacation - and I've never understood how rental car companies staff for their customers. They have to know the reservations they have on any given day. And to not have the proper staffing to move people through in a reasonable manner just befuddles me. \n\nHence, my one star rating of this particular Avis. I was in kind of a hurry to get my car and hit the road and all that stood in front of me were about 10 customers and three people to take care of them. And each transaction took crazy long while people declined coverage, said no to upgrades and the counter people had to call searching for the appropriate car. \n\nSo don't use Avis in PHX. The Avis at Philadelphia Airport, however, is awesome.
