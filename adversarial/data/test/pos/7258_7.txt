HELLO TOURISTS this is NOT  a place to bring little kids. Seriously. The noise, the smoke, your shoes stick to the ground. Beggars, homeless, overpriced sidewalk bars.  Dear city of Nevada. Please clean up Fremont Street.  Some of the \"performers\" who are nothing more that dudes in g-strings are hardly \"performing\". HAVE SOME CLASS. and I will now post photos of what I'm talking about.  THE ONLY thing I like about Fremont is The Golden Nugget hotel \/ casino. Grottos has the best pizza and the pool is amazing. SIDE NOTE: I've lived in Vegas for 7 years and have been to Fremont numerous times. Just don't bring babies!!.  and if you are a \"performer\" reading this. Try a little harder. Some are AMAZING.  you know who they are.
