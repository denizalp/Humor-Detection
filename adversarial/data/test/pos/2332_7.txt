Love paul.\n\nI met him first at the Adventurist's Afternoon Tea Time sponsored by Hendricks, and he did a GREAT job. The photos are awesome. \n\nI then have seen him at multiple yelp events, and I find him really nice. He always lets me rub his head. Which he shouldn't. C'mon paul. Don't let me get away with that!\n\nI'm a kinda a camera whore, and he's always said yes to taking my photos. I'm not sure about what happened with Chris P, and find that hard to swallow. There defo has to be a misunderstanding there.\n\nPaul's a great photog.
