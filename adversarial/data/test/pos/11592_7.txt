FOUR STARS WITH A DISCLAIMER!\n\nDespite fairly wretched service this little cafe serves such excellent pastries and freshly made crepes that I still gave it four stars.\n\nThe imperious Frenchman at the counter nearly sent me running for the door but I ignored his attitude and enjoyed my excellent cappucino and cinnamon crepe just the same.\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy was his adding up our bill in his head. He rounded up, which might not seem like a big deal if it's only a few cents but that is not cool, not cool at all.\n\nWhen you come demand a receipt but don't let it deter you from trying the fantastic buttery palmiers or apple tart.
