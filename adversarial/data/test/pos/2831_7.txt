This lee sandwich is better than the ones in San Jose calif.\n\nThis place is cleaner and the food is fresh. The one in San Jose on King Road serves old food to lots of dumb people who eat anything. Most look poor and homeless. \n\nThis franchise is doing a better job than the origional owners in San Jose.
