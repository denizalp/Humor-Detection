methink not is an understatement!!!!  i just called the shop because, we meaning my husband and i,  have been working with this amazing artist.  we have prepaid for full sleeve and they fired the tattoo artist we were working.  we were working  with the owner on getting  some of are money back when whoever answer the phone was rude and said there was no manger and the owner wasn't there.  when i said dougie name, (that was the really good tat artist that work on us), i though he was going to have a stroke.  i say don't bother all the good artist are gone from sin city ink!
