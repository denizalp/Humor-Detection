EnerCare aka Direct Energy. A new name with the word \"Care\". A billion dollar company would only change their name if they have a bad reputation in the past, don't you think? You know when they use a word like \"Care\" in their name it is because we know they really don't care. \"If you have to say it, it is likely untrue\". They us the word \"care\" yet their action or lack of action says the opposite.  EnerCare\/Direct Energy is renowned for their horrible service, this is not a secret. I don't know why any reputable developer would use such a firm when there are so many good other options to consider. I just spent almost 50 minutes on hold with EnerCare\/Direct Energy and was transferred 3 times trying to get the required forms to have a tenant hooked up on billing.  Any development or developer that uses this service is not putting their clients\/residents first. Unfortunately when a developer signs with a company like EnerCare (Direct Energy) then the residents have no choice, can't go elsewhere and the customer service goes out the window. EnerCare\/Direct Energy doesn't  need to provide any customer service because you can't go elsewhere. EnerCare\/Direct Energy know this.\n\nI highly recommend the extra effort to keep the good guys in business, these guys are not the good guys and should not be considered.
