Dined here with my family--8 people including a baby--on a Monday night and we were quite surprised to see that it was deserted. My brother expressed some hesitation upon seeing the lack of customers, but they trusted my research so in we went :)\n\nOne of the things I love the most about my family is that we eat like there's no tomorrow. So buckle up (or in our case, let it loose)..\n\nWe had:\n- Lumpianitas: Mini and perfectly crispy. It's really hard to mess up lumpia. Cute presentation--served in mini fryer baskets along w\/ sweet chili sauce. \n\n- Pancit bami: I detest dry pancit. Theirs was quite wet, and the noodles were pretty soft. If you like your noodles a bit more on the firm side, don't My nephew, who loves his lola's version, ate it all up. It was good. \n\n- Kare kare: Came in this cute little palayok w\/ grilled zucchini and shrimp paste on the side. The oxtail was tender, the sauce creamy and the green beans could've been cooked just a smidge longer (too tender for me). \n\n- Seafood Sinigang - They used kale and not the typical leafy greens for this dish (like bok choy or long beans). The broth had the perfect sourness from the tamarind, which makes sinigang addicting. I thought they could've added more seafood. The veggies were a bit too undercooked for me, but again, just a personal preference. \n\n- Crab fried rice: This was a hit for the entire table. They used a decent amount of real crab meat and the umami was on a whole another level!\n\n- CB house fried rice - This was good, but nothing too memorable. It had shrimp, sausage and I don't remember what else.\n\n- Sisig - Served on a sizzling plate, which always adds to the authenticity and came with all the accoutrements like egg (it was cracked on the plate and cooked by the time it came to us) + lemon wedges. They used only pork belly (it's traditionally nose-to-tail i.e. pig ears, snout, cheeks, liver, belly etc. ). I like my sisig crunchy, and theirs didn't quite cut it, but it was still delicious, and plus, I appreciate that it didn't contain any liver because I'm not tooo fond of it. \n\n- Green beans and squash: Ordering this was a silly attempt at making ourselves feel a little better about devouring such fatty and protein-rich dishes. I thought the squash and green beans were undercooked. When my mom cooks squash (like let's say in pinakbet), it's melt-in-your-mouth. I like it that way. It's perfect to eat with rice when it's mushy. Anyway, it's safe to say, this was the least popular dish at the table. \n\n- Pork adobo: Could've used a bit more tenderizing. If you're a seasoned adobo eater, you know there's a million variations of adobo. I prefer it to be on the darker side and swimming in thick sauce. This was it. The ratio of lean to fatty meat was great (you NEED some fat to amp up the flavor!!). Good, but it's adobo, and I never really order adobo when I dine out because, well, I've had my fair share of it and I'd rather order other dishes that are more exciting like Bicol Express or Binagoongan. SUE ME. \n\n- Beef Caldereta - Meat was quite chewy and my SIL thought it should've had potatoes. It was just beef and carrots, which was fine, but potatoes would've really complemented the beef and the sauce. \n\n- Bibingka soufflé* - Looked like a soufflé on the outside but the inside wasn't fluffy at all and it just fell apart. It was like eating the whites of a sunny-side up egg. It came w\/ a teeny portion of salted egg that sometimes go on\/in bibingka but it was just poorly executed. \n\n- Ube soufflé* - Better than the bibingka but wasn't exceptional. Light and had the right amount of ube flavor but it was grainy. I literally tasted and felt the granulated sugar on my tongue. It came with a mini ube piece. \n\n*Both soufflés came with their own sauces. You're supposed to make a hole in the center of the soufflé to pour the sauce in.  \n\n- Coconut flan: Never got to taste this, but my SIL loved it (she's Mexican and have had both Mexican-style and Filipino-style flan).\n\n- Chocolate lava cake with butter pecan: Our server gave this to us gratis because he overheard us talking about upcoming bdays in the family. Super sweet!\n\n- Calamansi juice - My dining mates ordered it, some enjoyed it but the others thought it was too sweet. \n\nService was prompt. We were hoping to order some food to-go for the moms, but weren't warned that the kitchen was closing. Would've been nice to get a heads up especially because we ordered so much food and still had dessert coming. \n\nDid they deliver on flavor and authenticity? For the most part, yes. Presentation? Yup, I love that they utilized nontraditional plateware like mini cutting boards. Service? It was good. Ambiance? The place was huge, and although it felt a bit weird to be the only ones there, it made for quite an intimate setting. Price? Pretty steep for some dishes--I mean oxtail kare kare for $20??...\n\nThere were hits and misses, but overall we all left feeling happy and extremely satisfied.
