This place is great! It has a great atmosphere, attentive\/friendly staff, and most importantly, awesome food! The pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer is a must! That cheese was so yummy, I couldn't stop eating it (and had to order another round because I felt bad that I ate most of it). Also, the fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Actually, scratch out \"probably\"....it definitely was!\n\nNote that I also discovered that fried chicken and champagne compliment each other very well! Or at least at this place anyway.
