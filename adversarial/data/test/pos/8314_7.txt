We had a group picnic here in long weekend. We arrived at the spot where we booked one of the area. We left all out belonging and food in our reserved area to check out the lake. \n\nWe got to the lake saw that they had a paddle boat so everyone from our group jump on it. Once we were done with the boat, we decided to get some snacks and than it was karaoke time :) \n\nBoys got tired of karaoke so we decided to play cricket. We played cricket for long time and we were having a good time that's when things started to go down. Kids were getting hungry so we decided to bring the food near lake. Couple of guys brought everything in a van and we backed it up to upload it. That's when the recreation staff came by and said we can't park the van here. We said, we are just unloading and we will move as we are done which we did. \n\nWe were still playing cricket and about twenty minutes after one white van comes park right in the middle of where we were playing so we called up those same guys who told us not to park. They told us that its official business. \n\nHmm.. White dude bringing his family for paddle boat is sure official business. Did I mention that all the recreational staff were white folks.\n\n The park is really great but the recreation staff are RACIEST!
