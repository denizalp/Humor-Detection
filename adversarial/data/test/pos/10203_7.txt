Kitchen Table is such a cute restaurant, really diggin the ambiance. Came here after dropping my mom off at work and was looking for a brunch spot on yelp and this came up. Our mission was to find a bloody mary spot but unfortunately they only sell beer and wine. Our waitress recommended their Bloody Beer and I ordered an iced mocha.\n\n- Iced Coffee Mocha\nThis was very delicious. I was shocked to see there was no mocha syrup inside my cup, normally you can see some chocolate but it was still bomb! Worth it.\n\n- Bloody Beer\nSince they didn't have any BMs we decided to try their beer version. It was pretty good, I have to admit. I'm not a beer person so that says a lot. Beer makes me bloated so I didn't drink much of this. Worth trying if you like bloodys and beer.\n\nI didn't want to eat anything too heavy since we were going to EDC that night. I only ordered two appetizers:\n\n- Greek Yogurt\nDon't let the small cup fool you, there was actually a lot of yogurt in this. It was good too, came with fruit and granola. Nice little meal if you're trying to stay on the healthier side.\n\n- Bacon & Egg Shooters\nI love deviled eggs, so I was stoked when I saw they had some. I don't know if my stomach shrunk but I couldn't finish this. I saved two eggs for later and glad I did, it was yummy having them for leftovers later that day.\n\nOur waitress was very helpful and gave great recommendations. She checked on us frequently and was very friendly. We left happy regardless of not having what we originally wanted.
