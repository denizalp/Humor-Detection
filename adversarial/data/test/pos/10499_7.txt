There is no question that this is the best pho' we have had outside of Vietnam.\n\nClassic, refined Viet. cuisine.  Bones boiling for hours for the broth.  Fresh lemon grass, star-anise, various aromatics and Thai basil.\n\nThe vegetarian pho' bun bo is filled to the brim with tons of seasoned tofu, glutens and the broth deep and exquisite.  \n\nMy last meal on earth ... let it be here.  Don't be fooled by the exterior of this place.  It is a respectable place with a nice clientele.    The restaurant itself is well-appointed and classy.\n\nMichelin star quality.  Nice family.  We will be back.
