Get the Dutch Crunch bread--you will thank me. \nI had the Count of Monte Chase-o (Ham, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss, Turkey) with onions peppers, dirty sauce lettuce and tomatoes. Now, I was nervous about this complex of a sandwich with strawberry preserves, but oddly enough it works. It was a little over $8 for a huge, filling sandwich with the best flavors and textures I have ever had in a single sandwich. My tastebuds are still dancing.\n\nThis is a San Francisco chain and it shows with enough \"LOVE\" stuff around to make me feel like I should have flowers in my hair and break out my old \"granny skirt\" from 1969. There are both booths and tables and chairs. The restaurant looks clean with ample parking right at the door. The employees are friendly and willing to take the time to explain this very complex, diverse menu. \n\nWithout a doubt this is the best sandwich shop I have ever been to.
