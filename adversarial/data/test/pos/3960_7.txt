This is my favorite Chinese fast food place (lots of my friends in Aurora love here as well)there's a small eat in area super casual:what most people are used to when they think of take out Chinese food places. Food is always fresh n hot. To South Americans this is what we are used to (except for some canadianized things like chicken balls) they have some Cantonese dishes. Wide menu,nothing surprising or out of the ordinary.Chicken fried rice,beef low mein, boneless sweet n sour pork,beef ho-fan noodles(either stir fry in soy sauce or black bean sauce),jar-do chicken wings,general Tao chicken,Singapore curry noodles,spring rolls & of course chicken balls are my usual order, sometimes breaded shrimp. Their batter is always fresh n crisp not soft or soggy. I give this a 4\/5 stars because sometimes they put too many onions in some of the dishes( but most Chinese restos do this to \"stretch\" food costs) so they are not the only villains in this practice. I have their food once a \nweek.
