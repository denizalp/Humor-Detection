A unique and wonderful dining experience. Our server, Ozzy, did a great job of explaining the unusual format so we knew exactly what to expect. \n\nThe room was a bit warm for me but that's understandable, considering there is a grill at every table, heating up the room.\n\nHelpful staff, great food, wonderful prices... I will definitely be back!
