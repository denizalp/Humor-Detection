I presume this is how hipster dive bars begin. I recall a Time Out Chicago article I once read that deconstructs the particulars of dive bar development.  \n\nOn the Darwinian continuum of diveyness Angelo's Lounge must be an amoeba. This has all the trappings of a hipster dive bar, but it falls short of the features you find at places like Bikini, Shady's or places in Tempe. Perhaps 10 years from now this will be a hipster hot spot.  Lately with new ownership they're reportedly starting to book bands more often.\n\nI went here with Bonnie to see a friend's band perform and I couldn't believe the inside of this place. It was freaking surreal like watching a bad movie in slow motion. Is that really 70s inspired outdoorsy silhouette wallpaper (photo posted above) on every inch of the walls? Is that really an 70 year old alcoholic trucker with a ZZ Top beard sitting three stools down from an indie-rock 25 year old Tempe girl?\n\nHere's what else you can expect:\n* Two pool tables.\n* No beers on tap, but Miller High Life by the bottle.\n* Cash only.\n* Mismatched floors.\n* Gross bathrooms with 80s-glitter inlaid sinks\n* Brick fireplace in the corner.\n* Jukebox with Linkin Park, Reba McEntire and Neil Diamond. Nuff said. \n* Falling water: the untrendy kind - like from a leaking roof here and there throughout.\n* Decrepit ceiling fans that looked like they were about to fall and go flying.\n*A veritable Mason-Dixon line of humanity: sketchy, trashy looking old fogeys and their admirers toward the front, indie rock-luvin hipsters toward the back. We were probably somewhere near Philly. And best of ALL...\n* A gigantic velvet landscape painting with a 6 inch gash in the middle. Klassy!
