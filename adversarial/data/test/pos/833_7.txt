Located near the entrance of the Downtown Container Park. Do yourself a favor and walk around the park a little more before deciding what you're going to eat.\n\nWith a name like Pork & Beans you'd think I would get real excited. You can call me an expert to pork and beans. It is my favorite dish. I've had them all and eat it at least once at week. Van Camp's, Campbell's, Bush's, Heinz, etc. LOL\n\nKidding aside. Yeah I dunno about this place. Supposingly Pork & Beans is one of Kerry Simon's places, who I guess is a celebrity chef from what I read. The menu, at least the menu I was presented with, included items like pork and beans, chili, sliders, hot dog, and few more ranging from $4-$9. Nothing that seemed impressive. It was more like I'm not gonna pay $9 for a hotdog especially when I just saw a sign across the street at El Cortez for a prime rib meal for $9.99.  I did however decide to try something, went with the Fancy Grilled Cheese being that it was priced in the middle at $7. It was aged cheddar with basil and tomato in a sourdough, seemed promising, it had \"Fancy\" in the name. But when it arrived I was truly disappointed. It really was just 2 slices of bread with a very little cheese, tomato, and basil. The fillings didn't even reach the edges of the bread and didn't even come with anything extra like fries or pork and beans. For $7 and from a chef or \"celebrity chef\" I would've expected more. Fancy!? I little kid could've done better. Let's just say I went to the nearest grocery store buy a loaf of bread, some cheese, a bag of tomato, and other items, even a can of pork and beans and go have a 5 year old make something fancy and better for about $7. I wonder what my food would have been like if I paid a dollar or 2 more.\n\nEven though I didn't try anything else, from what I saw in pictures and what came out to others I wouldn't mine giving them a 1 also, a 2 star might be generous. I even heard table next to me making fun of their food. They should've added a side of pork and beans to each item for the same price charged.\n\nYou don't have to go to Pork & Beans to get their food. There was a waitress going around the 2nd floor tables near Boozery, seemed weird since she gave me a drinks menu from the bar downstairs and a food menu from Pork & Beans which was all the way on the other side. She brought me food so I paid her.
