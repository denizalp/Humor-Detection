Get the steak salad. No, wait. Get the Cuban sandwich. No wait. Go with a friend that likes to share, get both and split them. It's a great meal to have.\n\nAlso, start with fried pickles. They are slices if that matters to you.\n\nAlso, get one of their awesome cocktails. I'd recommend the Pillow Talk.\n\nAlso, sit on the back patio. It's a lovely oasis in downtown Vegas.\n\nAlso, take me with you when you go. Please?
