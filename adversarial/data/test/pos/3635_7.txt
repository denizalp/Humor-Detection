The way to love this place is to keep your expectations realistic - we're talking about a less than $10 sushi meal, that will make you full. Are you looking for a fancy environment for a first date? Or perhaps beautifully plated sashimi? Or uni? No, go somewhere else. This is where you make plans with old friends for a quick bite, when you text and say \"din, midland\/finch sushi?\" and they reply with \"cool bruh, omw\".\n\nIt's tiny. The seats are cracking, so if you're wearing short shorts, be careful. I always order \"J\" meal, which comes with tempura, a handroll, sashimi (8-10 pieces), maki (~ 6 pieces) and sushi (~6 pieces). The sashimi is never precisely the same quantity, but that's because not every piece is cut the same size. Just go with it! Sometimes it's all salmon, sometimes they have some tuna in it. It depends on their catch. This costs $9.95, and comes with appetizer of edamame, tofu, congee, miso soup and fried salmon belly. Excellent price for being completely stuffed! \n\nOh, and that's also with green tea ice cream. \n\nPro tip - it's cash only!
