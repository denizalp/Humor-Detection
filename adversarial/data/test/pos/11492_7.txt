Hmmmm! Not my favorite cup of tea or should I say Starbucks. I give them brownie points for cleanness and presentation but the service was a slam dunk. This location has always moved so slow which is why I don't tend to venture on to this spot. Parking is very limited due to high traffic location with not even enough parking space. If they could at least step up their game on providing faster friendly service I could over the parking.
