This place has some really good points, but unfortunately it was let down by too many bad points.\n\nThe good:\n1. The guy preparing the food was very nice.\n2. The vegetables were all fresh and tasty and a good variety.\n3. The sauces were pretty good (although the hot sauce wasn't very hot).\n4. Prices were very reasonable.\n5. The meat was freshly cut off the spit and very tender.\n\nThe bad:\n1. The girl at the cashier was just miserable. Very unpleasant.\n2. While the meat was fresh and tender, it was severely lacking in seasoning. Even the salt was missing. Ugh. Salt is a necessity. If I had a bit with one of the pickles and the meat, it was fine. But if I had a bite with meat on its own, I could really taste how bland the chicken was. No bueno.\n3. The guy pressed the pita against the side of the spit (intentionally) and it ended up with this heavily smoky flavour on the wrap (like burned gas). Some people might like that; I did not. It was very strong and distracting flavour.\n4. My wrap was broken apart even before I started eating it. Every other wrap that he prepared before mine was breaking apart. Learn to wrap better or maybe get different pitas. \n\nI just don't think I'll come back for bland meat, falling apart wraps, and miserable cashiers.
