Okay, I was a poor college kid traveling with my friends few years ago and I still remember this horrible buffet now and want to WARN EVERYBODY NOT TO GO THERE! Even if you pay me now. \n\nSo, back then, we walked by their ad and saw some nice pictures for the circuit circuit dinner buffet. OH Boy... should have read the yelp reviews before we enter. My friends weren't even picky about food. We went there VERY HUNGRY but the everything there was just TERRIBLE. \n\nFood were cold, no flavor, taste like leftover from a long time ago. Let alone that all the \"hot\" food were either lurk warm or cold, shrimp didn't taste like shrimp, chicken didn't taste like chicken, cakes were terrible, the fruit didn't even taste fresh. We had to spit out some of the disgusting food. At the end, I think we all just ate a bunch of watermelon to fill our tummy.\n\nService.... er...was there any?\n\nThe next day, we decide to go to McDonald for Breakfast instead.
