5 minutes prior to my arrival at The Jungle Zone, I had a pair of pliers attached to the ring in my nose as my husband attempted to take it off for the first time. I don't know. He thought pliers were a good idea. Needless to say, I ran out the door screaming \"I'll be right back!\" seeking a professional's help to remove it. \n\nNow, who doesn't love a head\/tattoo\/piercing shop that has on The Cooking Channel? That cuts their intimidation factor by about 1\/2 and then everybody greets you when you walk in like in Cheers. Okay, not intimidating at all. I told them about needing to replace my ring with a stud and they offered to do the jewelry change for free. It took about 2 minutes and there were no pliers in sight. \n\nI just paid for my stud ($3.99) and a tip for the piercer's pro bono work. The owner (I think this is what Eric The Red (Viking) would look like in modern times) is so grateful for people coming in to help his small business. Definitely come check this place out if it fills your niche. The prices are fair and the guys are super friendly.
