Note #1: An alternate address for this is 3125 Banksville Road. It's to the right of Banksville Plaza if that helps you. \n\nNote #2: They also sell Nathan's hot dogs and various deep fried items. \n\nI am distraught. The Bruster's that occupied this very same space was miles better. \n\nI will say that the service was terrific, and the bland quality of the ice cream was in no way the fault of the employees. \n\nAs the name of the place makes clear, Carini's serves ice cream (hard-serve) and gelato. I ordered a brownie sundae with one scoop each of Black Forest and Cookie Dough ice cream only to lose any and all flavor in a mass of a powerless hot fudge and aerosol whipped topping. When I finally uncovered the sub-Little Debbie brownie, it was harder than the ice cream and barely edible. \n\nThe lemonade I had as a beverage was one stiff soft drink. Possessing nothing but bite, I initially thought it to be Mike's and wondered if it had fermented after sitting around for too long. Instead of dispensing the lemonade from a fountain, the employee pulled a large, topless pitcher of what looked to be a giant's urine sample from out of a floor-level cabinet, heaved it onto a counter, and nervously poured a serving of the yellow liquid (household cleaner?) into a paper cup.  \n\nLo there shall be backlash over this travesty. Bring back Bruster's!
