Hell to the YES. I love hummus, falafel, and other Mediterranean delicacies. This place hit the spot so hard. (I sound like a frat boy, don't I?)\n \nDon't try to eat the entire wrap in one sitting unless you want to ache for an hour afterward. I should have stopped. But pregnant Rachel = nonLeftovereater, and I went back for the second half only about 15 minutes after I finished the first. I was sorry, but I would probably do the exact same thing again.\n\nI would highly recommend this place! Service with a smile, and the food is brought out (we got takeout) HOT and fast.
