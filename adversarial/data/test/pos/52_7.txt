At 9 PM, the kids and I grabbed a bite at Denny's. I had the chicken noodle soup. It was a home style chicken noodle soup and seasoned on the salty side. It suited me perfectly because i was recovering from a cold and could hardly taste anything. My children ate the Strawberries and Cream breakfast. The pancakes were delicious, infused with white chocolate. The bacon was crisp, the hashbrowns were well seasoned. Our meal came up to under $15. Our server, Rohde was always helpful in refilling our glasses of water. I am happy that we have a nice neighborhood Denny's.
