I should probably begin this review by stating that I am not a mall person. I am not a shopper. I hate shopping. To me, it is much like a chore that I put off for weeks, maybe months. \n\nSo yesterday, my mother dragged me by hair, kicking and screaming to the beautiful Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio. I was only going because mummy dearest wanted to buy child of mine some new kicks. I thought it would be a quick trip. \n\nNot so. \n\nWe hung around for what seemed like hours. We even ate in the *gasp* food court! What a site to see, that one is. The people watching is pretty fantastic though. \n\nSadly, the shopping choices are not very fabulous at this mall. \n\nNot even a Gap anymore. But never fear mall goths, there IS a Hot Topic! And for the Lake Skank in your life there is Wet Seal, Hollister, and that lovely Victoria's Secret PINK hoo-ha palace. If you're a real woman... aka not a size 00 and want to be fashionable, well then you're absolutely fucked. You get the grandma department at JC Penney, Sears, or New York and Company (cue sad violin). Oh, and you also get MOCKED by the other stores and their ridiculously OFF sizing. And to throw some salt in that wound? No more Lane Bryant for when you feel extra tubby about not fitting into an Abercrombie size large. \n\n\"Great Lakes Mall promises a stress-free shopping experience.\"  -- that was taken from the Simon malls website. I disagree.
