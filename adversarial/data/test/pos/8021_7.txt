I can't believe I haven't written a review for Tresses yet. I've been a regular here for over 7 years. I started coming here when I moved to the area since it has a convenient location across from Islington station.\n\nThis is an Aveda salon with the whole assortment of Aveda products for the ladies (and perhaps gentlemen) out there who like to use good hari products. \n\nThere is also a spa, but I've never used their services so I'll stick to reviewing the salon.\n\nWhen you get a haircut, they start off with a complimentary scalp massage with one of three scented oils. I actually look forward to this when I go get my hair cut. It sends chills down my spine (in a good way!). \n\nThey typically wash and condition your hair before and after the cut, which is nice to get rid of the itchy little hairs. \n\nThey will also always offer me tea or coffee and a complimentary hand massage while they cut my hair. It feels nice to be pampered once in a while AMIRITE?!\n\nOh, if you drive, they validate parking for the underground garage so you don't have to pay.
