If Im downtown or in North Las Vegas, and I want some cheap fun, this bowling center is it. There's 35 lanes(I think), and on Friday nights they have Cosmic bowling. Also, I can slide over to the casino and put a 10 in the slots for a free beer and shot \n\nI can rent 2 pair of shoes, and get 2 games for me and my lady for $18. But order your food ahead of time at the snack bar, because BOTH of the employees like to take their extended 15 minute breaks AT THE SAME DAMN TIME! Just a tip.\n\nBut back to the $18. It only cost my fiancee $18 to get her ass DUSTED up and down the bowling alley while she wants to drink martinis talking shit. I was hittin those STRIKES!! Told her to SPARE ME the BS!!
