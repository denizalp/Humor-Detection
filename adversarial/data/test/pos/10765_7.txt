Thank's to Val G's previous excellent review, my vegan sweet tooth began to ache badly and was jonesing for a fix once I learned that Tori's Bakeshop opened up close by to me.\n\n Walking in I can't help but marvel at how adorably chic the set-up is here at Tori's with a serene ivory palette playing off pale olive green mouldings, I feel as though I've stepped into an editorial layout from Domino Magazine, it was that awesome!  What brought me here however is the fact that Tori's bakes some mean vegan treats.   \n\nI tried the GF \"butter\" tarts, a GF \"cheese\" and chives biscuit and a non GF (I'm allowed to cheat a little right?) Cinnamon bun.   The butter tart is extrordinary, and yes, I could not believe there is no butter in this tart!   The chive and \"cheese\" (Daiya, I suspect) biscuit is divine with the desireable crumply texture and just the right amount of soda'd saltedness, and lastly the Cinnamon bun was the right combination of sticky cinnamon goodness, coupled with a generous helping of rich frosting and a firm and pleasantly textured pastry.  \n\nAlthough the selection is still small and in it's infancy the super sweet & friendly counterperson assured me that Tori's will soon be introducing more goodies to the roster as well as vegan\/GF baked breads, so there is much to look forward to from Tori's in the near future.\n\n Hand's down Tori's have won my heart as the best vegan baked goods I've tasted in T.O.  Whether you are Vegan, Gluten-intolerant or not you deserve to indulge yourself at Tori's quaint little gem of a boutique bakeshop.
