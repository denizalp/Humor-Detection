I like cupcakes regardless of their popularity; you can do all sorts of things with them (decorations, build a pyramid) and they fit right in your hand, and are filling for their size. I've had some good cupcakes in my time. Sprinkles isn't on that list.  See I think that Sprinkles, as a company, doesn't really like cupcakes. I think they like the fact that they can bank on a fad. Their shop is very scene-y, which is the antithesis of the happy cupcake times I want to experience. Its the kind of place an anoerexic would go and gaze fondly at the cupcakes and then leave not having eaten anything. \n\nI went in and was immediately greeted by multiple employees, and was explained their rotating cupcake stocking system and told that their red velvet cupcakes were the most popular. I asked them if they used real beets to color the chocolate cake...they just gaped at me, then each other. Finally someone came up with \"...noo, we use red food coloring.\" well thrilling. FYI European studies are consistently showing that a number of red food dyes interact with children's endocrine systems causing migraines and ADHD symptoms and Red #3 has even caused tumors in mice! \n\nAnyway the magic of red velvet is the earthy play the beets offer, not just the color so I skipped that and when for Lemon Ginger. $3.51 is $3.51, but this better be a really good cupcake. Here we go: the frosting has the only flavor...lemon extract that is. It is sweet the way I like my frosting but a little crunchy and crystallized from sitting out all day. The cake was like moist cardboard. I mean that in the best way of course - the cake was fine but had zero taste. That was where I was expecting the ginger kick. When I finished it I realized that I was expecting ginger the root, when the real goal was the ginger flavor of boxed cakes which are two totally different worlds. \n\nIn the end I want a cupcake that tastes like someone made it with love...not necessarily love for ME, but love for cupcakes in general. Sprinkles is the McDonalds of cupcakes.
