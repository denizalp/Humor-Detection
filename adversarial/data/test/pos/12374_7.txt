Nothing like waking up at 5:30 am the day after an OYE... (not fun, and boy was I exhausted!)\n\nThe good thing about taking Colleen C to the airport bright and early this morning was that I planned ahead and scheduled a breakfast meeting at Palatte.  And now, after a couple of cups of coffee and an incredible breakfast, I feel like a new person.\n\nI definitely recommend Palatte on a weekday morning - no wait, fast, attentive service, and yummy food!  I'm actually still hanging out here working as the atmosphere is perfect for just that - hanging out!  \n\nI had a chance to chat with Ed and Christine, the owners, and fell in love with Palatte even more this visit than last time.  I think they are still ironing out the kinks as it's only been 3 weeks since their transition to full table service, but they are kicking ass so far.  I can tell they get plenty of regulars, and I would be one also if I lived in the hood.  The house they are located in is fabulous - comfortable, welcoming, and homey - tons of character which is sometimes hard to find in this city.\n\nThe Bev (sauteed spinach, tomato slices, and avocado) is what I ordered - and I love that they do it with egg whites for only $1 extra.  I chose whole wheat toast and fruit and it was exactly what the doctor ordered this morning!\n\nI can't wait to come back for lunch sometime soon, as their sandwiches, salads and tartes sound awesome from their menu descriptions, but it will be hard to tear myself away from the many breakfast items that are oh so amazing.  I guess I'll just have to come back again and again to make my way through the variety of selections.  \n\nA few more tidbits I noticed while hanging at Palatte today: \n**the bathroom is CLEAN!  So much so that I noticed... \n**with the check, you are given Bazooka bubble gum - who doesn't love Bazooka?!\n**they are planning some cool wine \/ cheese \/ live music events for upcoming first and third Fridays.\n\n****Note to self (and to all of you): Palatte is closed on Monday!  (I guess Ed and Christine need a day off also).
