I was hankering for some BBQ on the way from running errands and decided to try Big B's again!\n\n\nThe last time I did not have a great experience and I wanted to try it out again.\n\nThis time, my son and I ordered:\n\n1.  Tri Tip\n2.  Beef Link\n3.  Brisket - Moist Cut\n4.  Half Chicken.\n\nThe experience this time was absolutely awesome.  The Tri-Tip was so tender and juicy moist. I had asked the order taker if he recommended the Tri-Tip of the pulled pork.  Thankfully, I listened to him and it was the best. \n\nThe moist cut Brisket was so tender. I really think it is the best in LV.  I stopped using fork and knife and went all hands as it was the best way to eat this stuff, faster than my son...\n\nThe chicken is the dark meat, leg and thigh.  So juicy and the meat is perfect as it falls off the bone.\n\nThe Beef Link had the right amount of spicy kick to it and I am glad I ordered it as I always wanted to try it.\n\nService was great, food was great and I am glad that they have their greatness back.\n\nGK says, definitely go back.  The best thing was, i ordered all this at the end of the day toward closing and all the food was perfect, juicy, tender and moist.  So glad I came back here!
