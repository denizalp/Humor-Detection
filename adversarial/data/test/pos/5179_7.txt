I tend to stay in downtown most of the time, so coming to the strip is an experience in how the other half lives. The half that reside at the Cosmopolitan are lucky sons of bitches. \n\nI LOVED this hotel. LOVE LOVE LOVED. It's so pretty and kitschy and I'm sure some people who are used to the finer things aren't impressed, but I totally was. I'm used to dingy ass, smoke-filled casinos full of old people, so this hotel made me feel like a slack-jawed yokel in a big city. Everyone there was so attractive. I'm super not-gay, but my gosh, the chicks walking around were total babes. The Cosmopolitan makes me want to spend all my money on my appearance so I can mix into that crowd with ease (funny, the magazine of the same name has also made me wish for this). \n\nWe got cocktails at the Chandelier bar, and they were outstanding. One of them came with orange marmalade and maple syrup foam? WTFFFF? I like food and booze too much to not be insanely impressed. I could go on forever, but you get the point, right? Worth checking out.
