I really enjoyed this place.   The food was good.   Generally, when you do an all you can eat, you sometimes get lesser quality meats, but that was not the case here.   I do have to admit that service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday night and it was packed and thus I did not mark them down for such.   I think for the price, this is a great place to eat.
