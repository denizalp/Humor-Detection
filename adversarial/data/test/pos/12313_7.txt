BUSY ALL THE TIME!! Every time I eat at Cabo it's packed. Doesn't seem to matter if it's on a monday night or a friday night. They are always hopping. One thing's for sure, though, the food is worth the wait! I haven't had anything I didn't LOVE here! My usual are the bbq mahi tacos with a side of slaw. YUM. Just the right amount of spice for me on the tacos and the slaw is delicious. The beer selection is pretty great and they have margaritas galore. Parking can be tricky because NODA has limited spaces near the main drag. Be prepared to walk a little.
