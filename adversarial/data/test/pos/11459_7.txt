Sister treated my mom and I to trowback concert for mama's birthday. Talk about turning back time. Their music has always been amazing, but their performance impacts your soul just as much. They were right. REAL music. It's always nice to just sit back, and enjoy feel good music. Music that really moves your soul. You experience this concert, and majority of the time (if you know the songs) you'll be singing along, dancing, or standing. \n\nTheir costume ensembles were so cute! Loving the their cardigans when they did their acapellas! Perfect timing! They sang mama. So my sister and I were seranading my mother as they sang too! It was so fun and a must see for sure. Especially for your lady friend (if you're lookign to get some brownie points. HERE'S YOUR HINT!) \n\n\nSuggestion: If you don't get front, do get isle seating. They boys walk the isle and sing to the ladies and hold their hands (panty droppers!) They also throw roses to the audience as well so run to the stage. Hold their hand. Come home with a momento of the Boyz! Even the guy audiences were running up there to grab roses! \n\nIt truly is a moving performance, and watching the show and listening to their music again makes me wish that this generation could make music like that again. Music that matters. Music that changes people. Music that moves people. No booty shaking or popping bottles. Just good old soulful music.
