I decided to give this place a try after seeing it here on Yelp. I came with my husband and he ordered a smoothie before we decided on what to eat. A minute later, we could hear a man screaming expletives (Fbombs galore and something about working faster) in the kitchen. He was so loud that the whole restaurant heard. We were sitting right by the open kitchen but couldn't see who was yelling. By the uncomfortable looks of the wait staff and their inability to do anything about it, I assumed it was either a manager or the owner. I couldn't believe that our waitress was actually asking us, with a forced smile, if we decided on what to eat. She must be on some serious antidepressants to work here. If this guy is screaming at kitchen staff, I refuse to eat the food coming out of that kitchen! I glanced at the table near us and we shared a WTF look. Hurriedly, they payed and left. We plunked cash down for our tiny overpriced smoothie and left too. The guy was still screaming as we exited. Thanks Bachi, for treating us to an extremely uncomfortable tirade that rightfully belongs in an episode of Restaurant Stakeout.
