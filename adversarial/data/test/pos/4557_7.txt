Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay!\n\nEnter, the Children's Museum of Phoenix!\n\nThe facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy! \n\nAfter you pay your standard $11\/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child!\n\nAfter your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as \"Plinko-esque\". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...it's a shame she'll ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.  \n\nAfter Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities!\n\nAfter cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. There's a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store.\n\nAfter shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels.\n\nBeing only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling!\n\nHow on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?
