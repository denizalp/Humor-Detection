Great little nightlife spot in Old Town. Friday nights Are hip-hop\/R&B with live music then DJ. The spot has a private VIP lounge, dance area, and patio partying in different areas. The doorman, host, service staff and servers are wonderful to work with. The Promoters for table service are also very nice. The lounge is neat and classy. It's always a good time with a great crowd. \n\nThe food is very good here. Plenty of tables to sit down and enjoy a meal.
