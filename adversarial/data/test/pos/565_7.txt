Not impressed. I'm a firm believer in holistic medicine; that's why I came here. I have never had much luck with conventional medicine. I do have a homeopathic doctor that I normally see but his office is located about 2 hours away making it not the most convenient. I was hoping that I could find closer help. No such luck. Money wasted for me. Awesome that this team of doctors can help others but I would recommend looking elsewhere. My whole experience was bad. Everything felt awkward. I was used to the non conventional testing but not the strange silence and no one explaining what the tests were for and what they were doing. The doctor kept recommending all these supplements and treatments and I couldn't even drag an explanation out of him. \nIt was recommended that I get a special treatment that only the main doctor could administer. When I declined it was not taken well. I was berated and yelled at in the lobby in front of other waiting patients. This is not ok by me. \nBy far this was one of the worst experiences I have had. I came out of the appointment feeling worse than when I went in. There is a difference between doctors trying to make a quick buck and doctors who really care about helping people. This experience made it pretty clear to me. Guess I will go back to driving that 2 hours.
