Compared to other food establishments in Mandalay, I thought this place was pretty good. I certainly would not go out of my way to eat at any establishment at Mandalay Bay, but when you are staying there, it is a good option. Why? Well, breakfast is 17.99 a person and lunch is I think 23.99. The first time we got the champagne brunch for 25.99 (unlimited champagne a $5 add-on) and it was good. Crab legs and lots of seafood options. Was it the best? No, but I kinda like working for my food as I crack the small but really sweet crab legs. Shrimp are farm-raised, not good. My hubby concentrated on the yogurt and fresh fruit and the all-you-can-eat-bacon. When we missed breakfast, there was still oatmeal, grits, and fruit for breakfast. \n\nThere is a decent crowd here and when we got by one group of Latino Gangsters (not being racist, I'm just being real, my hubby is black), the staff we're willing to move us to a quieter more peaceful spot. \n\nThere might be better buffets, but when you don't want to go far, this is great.
