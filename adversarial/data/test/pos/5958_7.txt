As much as I loathe this city, I took a weekend to spend it with Mom for a girly weekend.  Mom loves this place, so I had to take her again for another try.  It was my first.  \n\nThe place is beautiful.  You do not feel like you just walked out a stinky casino.\n\nThe service...no more than terrible.\nOur server was completely intrusive and at times intentionally rude.  I think he was trying to be funny, or amusing himself at our expense.  I do not think that you come to a Keller restaurant to be absolutely annoyed by a passive aggressive waiter.  I could pay my local dominatrix the same price I paid here and get heaps of aggressive rope burn without the passive weenieness.  I almost called him a dick like 5 times.  I used to work in restaurants for a long time, so I have a bit more patience with service than most.  \n\nI don't know if that effected the way I ingested, but the food was not what I was expecting.  In fact, it was just OK.  I ordered scallops, and there was so much grit, I sent it back.  Of course, (I'll call him \"Eugene\") Eugene looked at me like I was a Hitler Youth for suggesting that what he was serving was sub-par.  \nHe took it off the bill and acted as if he was doing us a favor.\nIdiot.  \n\nI think I may try French Laundry another time.\n\nNEVER again with this place.
