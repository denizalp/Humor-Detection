Our group of 3 wound up at Carly's after an event at the Dodge Theater. We were starving and wanted a quick bite and a drink. We first went to the Roosevelt but they stopped serving food at 11 so we walked to Carly's instead.\n\nAbout two years ago I stumbled into Carly's one afternoon on a whim, not knowing what it was or being terribly familiar with the area. I remember the service being somewhat slow. I was in there for about an hour but it was also a weekday and very busy. \n\nEven so I wanted to try it again, mainly for their beer selection. I nearly had a heart attack as I was waiting for my sandwich because I saw they had Chimay on tap. I had to do a double take. I've found in general Arizona bars\/pubs have an extremely poor selection of beers on tap. To find some good Belgian Ales is like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There's always the rare gem of a bar\/pub here and there that serves some killer stuff and Carly's is one of those places.\n\nFast forward to recently...in my daze of hunger and my recent quest to find the best bloody mary in the Phx area, I totally forgot how excellent Carly's brew selection was. I ordered a bloody mary and Europa sandwich instead. Both were very good, in fact it was the best bloody mary I've ever had so I'm glad I forgot about the beer. \n\nIt was interesting that the beer was $8 (but being reverse happy hour it was only $7) and my bloody mary was $4.50. Usually it's the other way around but I guess I'm not surprised considering their good selection on tap.\n\nIt would have been nice to have a little more than a spoonful of pasta salad with the sandwich. Other than that, everything was fantastic!! I'll definitely be back to try the beer and eat.
