I was running my mouth at a \"bar that features nudity,\" and wound up taking a beating for it.  Dustin Dingman explained my options to me and allowed me to make the call. He got me a pretty good settlement without going to court but was prepared to go to trial if that is what I chose to do. I recommend this firm to anyone who wants great representation and not someone who will blow smoke up your a*$.
