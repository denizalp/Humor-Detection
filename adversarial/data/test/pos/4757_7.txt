*Runs to stage. Grabs Mic. Clears throat for first review*\nMcBonie's has the best & most consistent offering of home cooking or \"soul food\" in the city. I heard the radio spots promoting the bar and \"club\" atmosphere on the weekends. It wasn't until I received the restaurants.com two for one coupon that I decided to give the food a try.\n\nOn my \"cheat\" days I go in & have myself some fried pickles, the chopped steak, mac & cheese, collard greens and I wash it down with a \"diet\" coke.\n\nIf you happen to get stuck in between dinner and the party ... there is a sense of domestic tranquility, everyone is represented from the Bougie Prince & Princess, to the young & old professionals, to your average around the way homeboy & homegirl. Next time I'll stay for the party. \n\n*Drops Mic. Walks off stage wiping my mouth & unfastening my pants*
