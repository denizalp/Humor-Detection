This bar is basically one of the most exciting and fulfilling establishments available in the Steeler Nation. I know people who have spent most of their adult lives in this bar. I know people with tattoos based on the logo of this bar. I know people that won't go anywhere but Gooskis, who mean \"Gooskis\" when they say \"the bar.\" I know of relationships and marriages that have started and ended at this bar. I have seen hearts sing, and get broken in this filthy, smoky bar. I hesitate to even tell you how great it is because I don't want to mess it up. \n\nGreat bands & shows, with sweaty crowded dancing friends and strangers, excellent jukebox, amazing drinks, quality beer at ice cold temperatures poured out of clean(ish) taps, delicious bar food, prices frozen in 1981, and a diverse and interesting cast of characters seated at the bar & working behind it. Watch out, though. One time a trashed drunk dude grabbed my ass, and when I confronted him, his girlfriend got mad at me and tried to fight me. This is the sort of bar where neighbors bring over christmas lights to decorate for the holidays. \n\nThere's a bunch of dirty punks hanging around here, a crowd of meatheads, some normal working people, some of Pittsburgh's elite intelligentsia, and so on. Generally you don't find a lot of students (or \"short-timers\") at this bar. This is for those who bleed black & gold, with roots in the allegheny AND the mon, or at least people who can adopt a reasonable yinzer accent & attitude (without irony?). PLUS THERE IS SOME M-FING PINBALL OK?\n\nThis is more than a bar, really. It's not fair to call it that. It's a legend and an institution.
