Little Woody's is super cool.\nReally, you feel like one of the cool kids here.  But not like football star lead cheerleader cool, no  no, little Woody's is too cool for that traditional type of cool.\nNo, first you feel speak easy cool.  Old school gangster cool.  Because there is no sign announcing the name of the place you feel in the know when you spot the big eyed owl gazing over the street and realize this is the place.  It's too cool for a name.  You enter through the back, which is the front, because the front has no entrance.  Cool, right?\nThen its dark.  not seedy dark, but masculine and sultry dark.  Again, really cool.\nOnce you get your drinks you head over to the game room and a new kind of cool hits: nerd cool, gamer cool, arcade kid cool.\nShuffle board, skee ball (!), darts  and foosball are always exciting, and winning free beer with your insane skee ball skills is the coolest!\nDidn't eat this time, but the chalk boards advertised some tasty looking options.  And their cocktails, while maybe a bit pricey, were super intriguing.  I stuck with beer on this occasion and it was frosty and quick.  Good night.
