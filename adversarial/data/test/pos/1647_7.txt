With limited options during the annual overseeing season in September around Las Vegas, I found my way to Wildhorse for the first time because GolfNow offered a last minute Hot Deal that was about what most golf courses charge for a large bucket of range balls.\n\nDid I get my money's worth at Wildhorse? Sure. \n\nWould I play here again at a higher rate when more courses in the area are open? No.\n\nAs Tom S noted in his review a couple months ago, Wildhorse is simply not maintained or landscaped well. It took me a couple minutes and a second set of eyes on multiple occasions to find my drives that came to rest in the middle of the fairway. \n\nThat shouldn't happen anywhere if guys operating mowing equipment give a damn about the golf course.\n\nTee box and green conditions were average, which is a positive this time of year in Vegas.\n\nThis course is relatively short, only a Par 70 and many Par 4's play tight. Sort of reminds me of the feeling of playing in a box like at Desert Pines. Although without all the huge mounding between fairways.\n\nHonestly, I left after nine holes for a few reasons:\n\n1. Pace of play was too slow for a Tuesday late morning \n2. The golf course didn't challenge me or look inviting enough to stick around\n3. Even by leaving after the front nine, I only paid $1.44 per hole to play. (Do the math)\n\nOf the nine holes I played, I enjoyed a couple of the Par 3's, the one Par 5 and the Par 4 ninth because of how the fairway ends abruptly with a forced carry to a well-protected green.\n\nEmployees seem nice, GPS and carts are fully functional and atmosphere is very relaxed.\n\nIf I was a local, I could see coming out here simply for the value and the fun. \n\nI'm not local. So I want a better golf experience on my regular 3-4 day visits to Las Vegas.
