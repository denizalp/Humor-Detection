Ate here last year with work colleagues. We did not find the food good at all. We gave it a star because Yelp will not let us give the place zero.\n\nFiasco with KN apparently happened. We do not care bout it! What we do care bout is the quality of food, and service we received.\n\nHere is an update:\nWas excited to learn of it's grand re-opening. \nAte there last nite. The service was inconsistent. The food was still sub par.\n\nSorry. I, and my colleagues, will not be returning at this establishment again.
