Wahoo is a kid-friendly lunch or dinner outing. I was surprised by the open seating. The kids each enjoyed a fish taco (corn tortilla, soft taco) which was accompanied with with rice and black beans. You can choose your protein choice (e.g. chicken, shrimp, tofu) ; my children opted for fried fish (grilled fish is also available). Each plate costed under $4.  We checked in with Yelp! and claimed the offer of FREE chips and red salsa. \n\nFYI\n\nKID'S MEALS - NV\n\nKid's Bowl\n\nAny protein served over Rice & Beans\n\nKid's Plate\n\nTaco with any Protein or Cheese Enchilada w\/ Rice & Beans or Fries\n\nMini Quesadilla\n\nWith Rice & Beans or Fries\n\nBlack Bean & Cheese Burrito\n\nThe service was helpful and the staff was cheerful. The tables and seating areas were clean. TV's aired sports which was just the happy medium (relieved to have no news or no Cartoon Network). \n\nThe bathrooms are gender neutral which makes it easier when I am helping my children. The slide locks on the doors are placed up about 5' which can make it a little tricky. My recommendation is to stay with your children to ensure their safety and security.
