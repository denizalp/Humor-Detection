I have no idea what i just witnessed...She didn't sing, barely moved, and looked pretty bored the entire show! Yes... Her dancers are good but it's not the Britney's dancer show. Sure the lighting was cool... But it all wasn't enough to overcome the obvious lack of talent that woman has.I've seen so many amazing shows and concerts here in Vegas and this was not one of them. I feel I would've enjoyed a Britney impersonator better. Seriously bad. #icanteven
