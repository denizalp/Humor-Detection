Beautiful, fresh and colorful arrangement was delivered to my house today! I was so pleased with how full and pretty it was. The flowers were purchased by my hubby through FTD so I've never been in the shop or used this florist directly but based on this experience I totally would! It also came with a coupon for future use. One star off because they left the arrangement on our doorstep when no one was home and things have a strange way of disappearing in these parts, even in decent neighborhoods.
