I'm here to say I don't know anything about nails or facials or any of that stuff, but I do know about getting hair off my body and Tracy is my go-to for that and she is amazing. 10 stars. Would recommend to anyone. The gem in this place. Seriously. Never even one hair left. Never rushes me. Never phones it in. It doesn't even hurt. She is lightning fast, clean, professional, charming, and skilled. I wouldn't f*ck with anyone else in this city now. Perfect, every damn time.
