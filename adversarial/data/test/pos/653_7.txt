Like most Aloft hotels, they've got all your basic needs covered for a business traveler. For me, all I really need is comfort, cleanliness and safety. Everything else is just icing on the accommodations cake. \n\nIn terms of amenities, they've actually got a bit more than the basics. They've got a pool (just outside of the lobby which is a slightly awkward location) as well as the WXYZ lounge if you'd like to hang out for a drink or watch a sporting event in a common space. \n\nWhile some folks wrote about noise complaints, I immediately noticed that my room was prepped with earplugs by my bedside, so it's great that they're aware and have made the effort for their guests to have a more peaceful experience in their room. Luckily, I was spared any excessive noise during my visit, aside from the lovely gentleman in the shower in the room next door that unknowingly serenaded me while I brushed my teeth in the morning.\n\nOverall, I'm giving this hotel a 4 star for what it's meant to be and what it delivered. Pretty solid, pretty simple with all your basic needs met.
