I am so confused on how this place earned a 4 star rating... When we walked it the place is filthy and the people working lack decent customer service skills. \n\nWe had an appointment this morning and when I walked in I had to wait to be acknowledged, it was only after a personal conversation ended did someone ask me if i had been helped.\n\nI started to let her know what I wanted done to my furbaby and this lady decided she would argue with me telling me what type of haircut I should have on my dog. After explaining again I know EXACTLY what I wanted and she then told me that she knew what she was doing and that I should just trust her.\n\nShe tried to pick up my baby by aggressively grabbing at him and chasing him behind me and then got mad at me when he snapped at her. I told her you are not making him or me feel very comfortable doing that she said well then just hand him to me. I told her no and walked out.
