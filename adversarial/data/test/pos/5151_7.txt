Okay, so when they first opened, I have to admit that I was not that interested. They took over a previous business, and I just wasn't into trying this out. MISTAKE! This place is not what you would expect. \n\nThe interior is so nice. It is as if you are eating at your own home. You are given real silverware and plates, not cheap plastic. The ambiance is relaxing and homey. The worst part was the cashier. She looked as if she could care less that we were there. No smile, no welcome, nothing. My husband thought that maybe she had difficulty understanding us? My interpretation was that she just didn't care. \n\nBut the food is what got us. The beans were excellent, and the food was so flavorful. It came out nice and hot. We loaded up with sauces and limes at the little bar, and they even have a selection of hot sauces in bottles placed on the wall next to the bar. \n\nThis is a really nice place, go and check it out!
