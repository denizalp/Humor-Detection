Finally convinced my dad to come here one day when we were the last two to fend for our dinners after everyone else ate pho. I convinced him to try something new,  and attempted to make a reservation on a Sunday night but they were booked solid til 8pm. We arrived at 7 and I let the hostess know my name and its a table for 2. She let us know it'll be 15 to 20 mins wait,  I went towards the front as all the guests before us (about 3 small tables) and 1 table after us were seated. She looked at me and started asking for how many before realizing she already spoken and forgot about us. She then said another 10 minutes before a table will be ready. When we were finally seated in the room in the back there were many tables available so I'm not sure what the delay the whole time was for.\n\nEither way I was super excited about the food and our waiter was friendly and funny. We ordered the prosciutto pizza (I've been craving Al Forno pizza all month) and the fried veal and rice balls. The first few bites of the rice balls were really good,  fried crispy on the outside but doused with delicious tomato sauce made the perfect combination. The bites of melted cheese inside were a nice surprise and added to the medley of flavors. I wish the meat wasn't so minced because we could hardly tell that it was meat. It came with a nice salad on the side. Tip: these balls were huge,  could definitely be a meal. \n\nNext time I'll order them to come out separately cause the rice balls were very good hot and fresh but then started getting soggy and mushy add we dug in on the pizza. The waiter did offer this choice, I just didn't think it through. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! The saltiness of the prosciutto was nicely balanced with the fresh ingredients of arugula, tomatoes and cheeses on the pizza.  I would have tried dessert if I wasn't so deliciously full. Next time for sure! \n\nTheir pizza oven broke down after ours came out so I felt pretty bad for the pair sitting next to us having to watch us ready our pizzas. Since the tables were extremely close together they could practically taste or pizza and we could smell their disappointment. Also heard their whole conversation. :\/\n\nIt did take a while for us to get our waiter's attention to fill our water glass and get the bill which came back with too much change. Lucky for him we were honest and left the extra. Hopefully on my next visit the service will be great and that will prove that it was just an off night for them. \n\nNext time I'll bring my friends armed with a reservation and a bottle of wine!
