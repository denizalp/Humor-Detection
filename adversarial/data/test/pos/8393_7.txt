Hmmmm. Y'know, for a place that is laboriously trendy, you'd think they would have dreamed up a more inspired name. \n\nFinding out that LB+K's kitchen had caught fire from the blatantly distressed, remorseful owner himself when last we visited created a tender spot in my heart for them. So without brunch plans this Sunday, Kay and I decided to give them another shot early in the afternoon. \n\nWhen strolled in, we were told to seat ourselves and noticed that the joint wasn't exactly stirring with activity. In fact, no one was eating anything yet.\n\nOur minds were set on trying their brunch. Kay ordered the Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Steak and Eggs but was told by our petite server Tee that they were out of steak.\n\nSo I went with the Local Pittsburgher, a burger with caramelized onions and a fried egg along with raw onion, tomato, lettuce, and a few pickle spears. \n\nEhhhh, I dunno. My patty, which I ordered medium, seemed to come out well-done. The egg, like the patty, was a little overcooked as well. The bun tasted slightly stale. However, the fries that came with the burger were crispy, soft, and were pretty accomplished over all. \n\nDessert consisted of a block of tiramisu that came off as a thawed-n-shipped, not local, creation. It wasn't deplorable, but I could probably get something just as good out of a supermarket freezer. \n\nI definitely picked up a hipster vibe as young urbanites gravitated towards the window seats in order to be seen. The decor was kind of \"rough\" like a warehouse loft apartment.  \n\nRegardless of LB+K's lack of activity this afternoon, the service was slowwww goin', man. \n\nOne male server was apparently a bit, uhhh...cheeched if you feel what I'm gettin' at. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RPvZ173xNnw\n\nThe female servers both wore brushed-on black leggings in order to display the contours of their buttocks, create an illusion of  waist-down nudity, and therefore bring in the male big-spenders. \n\nSweat pants are worn for comfort also, so I don't care to hear that defense. For what it's worth, the guys wore baggy jeans. Those are comfortable too. The girls don't wear those, however, since nobody stares at an ass obscured by loose denim. Is that what they want me to do? Gawk at booty? I was with my girlfriend! Even if I wasn't dining with Kay or was single, does management want me to think a nice tip might *ahem* get me somewhere with a waitress?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bvbETP7LM74\n\nDoes the dress code come from above? \n\nI suppose I feel insulted a tad since my libido's expected to give way to logic in these instances. I also find it a bit degrading for the help involved.\n\nNonetheless, I generally tip well out of sympathy for the service industry and due to having a big, dumb heart. Solidarity.\n\nI was rooting for LB+K. Meh. \n\nP.S. Tee was a nice enough waitress, and I wager our long wait was more the kitchen's fault than hers. \n\nP.P.S. For those who like booze with their brunch, Mimosas and Bloody Marys are available. \n\nP.P.P.S. Kay's Eggs Benedict was easier on the eyes than any chick in tights. Nice plate job, dude.
