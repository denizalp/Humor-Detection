I Love Vegas. It's like my 2nd home. I think I've stayed at every hotel, well the ones that are 4 stars and above =D \n\nCame here last weekend with 2 of my Best Girlfriends. Valet was on it, they immediately assisted us with our bags and check in was completed in less then 10 minutes. When we entered the room it was nice, clean and room temperature was perfect. I like the way the room is setup. It's pretty spacious and having a mini kitchen is definitely a plus. When we called the bell desk to have our bags delivered, the lady said it would take 1 to 1.5 hours to get our bags since there backed up. Really, because we dropped our bags off no more then 15 minutes ago. She said there was nothing she could do. I waited a few minutes and my gf and I decided that we weren't going to wait. So as were about to open the front door the Bellman has our bags. Yay! He apologized and did say the are very backed up but made an exception. He was a sweetheart and asked if we wanted him to take pictures of us with my camera. Sure, why not? So there he was snapping away from about 10 minutes.. I thought that was pretty nice to offer. \n\nThe rest of the stay was good. The bed was comfy and so was the couch. It's not one of those hotels you can hear everything in the next room. Wink Wink. That was a plus. \n\nThey allowed us to check out @ 12 instead of 11. Surprisingly there were only 2 other people waiting in the check out line. So we checked out and waited for valet. This is where I deducted my star. We waited, waited and waited and finally they brought us our car 45 minutes later. \nIf that's the only negative thing I can say about The Signature then I think that's pretty good..
