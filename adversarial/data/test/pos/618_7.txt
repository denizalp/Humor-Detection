Came here for a recent AZ Instameet and was surprised by the quality of the food! I mean I understood the concept of the place but did not think it would be pulled off so well! They've really set the bruschetta game standard, and also have great meat\/cheese plates. The drink list includes both local and out of state craft beers which I really like. And the music! Oh my lord they have the best chill music choice of any place I've been to in the area. The outdoor patio is nicely designed as is the interior, giving off an upscale feel while still allowing some room for the casual. I can't wait to return for brunch and to try one of their mimosas!
