I'm giving this company 1star because moving furniture is such hard work, especially in fresno heat. My husband and I have had a dissapointing experience with this company and with Craig-the owner- who knows nothing about customer service.\n    We used this company only to load up our moving truck. We had a living social deal and we got three guys to help us load all our boxes and furniture into our moving truck. We've moved a lot of times and have had our share of hired movers, but never have we experienced such a poor job. When we arrived at our new home, there was maybe a couple of pieces of furniture out of our entire 3br, 2ba home that wasn't damaged. From minor damage to severe damage. What was more shocking was that the reason there was so much damage was because they didn't wrap or pad most of the furniture!! Not our very expensive dining room table legs (that I specifically told them to extra pad), or our couch ( that had a huge gash in the cushion and was filthy). They didn't even pad a huge 9foot heavy wood mirror! We are having to replace furniture in our sons room that was broken bc was not wrapped or padded. We have to buy a new living room couch because our couch was ruined. The dining room table is my favorite most expensive piece of furniture that we just can't afford to replace yet. Who doesn't at least plastic wrap nice wood furniture? When my husband noticed our dining room chair put into the truck up high a scrubbing against the metal beam, scratching it, he asked the movers to wrap it and move it and  pointed out it was getting scratched. The chair alone is $250. Wen the furniture was pulled out of the truck, the chair was still there, unwrapped, and totally ruined from the metal beam scraping the wood up. I was devastated when I saw our furniture after this move. \n    My husband called Craig to talk to him about this and review the reimbursement clause in the contract. Craig answered the phone and said he would call him back that afternoon because he was 'not in the office'. Craig never called. We called several times and left messages, but Craig wouldn't answer our calls. We then received an email later that night that was rude and stating they were not responsible for any damage and no apology. Nothing sincere and nothing about why Craig hasn't returned our call that he said he would. We still have not heard from him and he will not answer our calls. It is always a lot of money to move and we do not have extra money lying around- so to arrive at a new home and find that almost every piece of furniture we own was damaged - some pieces that cannot be repaired- is not only depressing but very expensive. It is then a slap in the face to be treated as rudely as we were by Craig after his movers poorly wrapped (or not at all wrapped) our furniture and poorly placed and positioned it while loading. I have read the previous rants that Craig has posted on yelp to another  customer who posted bad reviews, and I am not surprised. The things he said seem very much in line with the same way we were treated -with no regard for customer service.
