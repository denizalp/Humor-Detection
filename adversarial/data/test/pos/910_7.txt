Short version? It sucked. But WHY did it suck? Ok, let's start from the beginning. I called around 8pm to place my order. I ordered DD's simple sandwich first, then went on to mine, which is always complicated. I requested the Veggie with no cheese, no mayo, no tomatoes, and no cucumbers. Then I stated that in place of the things I was omitting, I'd like extra avocado spread. He said, \"ok.\" Then I proceeded to add my freebies like sprouts, oil & vinegar, peppers, etc. It had been a while since I'd ordered JJ's for myself, so I couldn't recall if they gave you a pickle spear with your sandwich (I'm 80% certain the JJ's back home did), so I asked. He said, \"Yeah, you can get them on the side.\" Ok, sweet. \n\n@ 8:55pm. JJ's arrives. I look at the receipt and I was charged for the extra avocado spread and for 2 orders of pickles. Why did he not tell me that he was charging me for these things? Granted, this is only a couple of bucks, but it's the principle. I called and spoke with the manager, Nick. I inquired why, if I omitted cheese (which costs $0.75 to add), would I be charged $0.75 for the extra avocado spread? It clearly evens itself out. He basically said that his POS (the cash register) wasn't sophisticated enough to handle the swap. Really? THAT's your excuse?! I asked for the GM, whom Nick stated had just quit last week, so.... At this point, I'm just done. I didn't even get to the darn pickles. In that moment I decided that I simply won't patronize this JJ's again. (Did I mention that the sandwiches were freezing cold when they arrived? Any other JJ's always toasts my bread.)  There is a JJ's down the street, by the Quarter; I'll give them my business instead.
