Taste buds loved me for this, but my stomach hated me afterwards... one of THE best buffets I have ever been to!!! I had to go ironman status for this one!! I really wish I could've eaten more but my stomach resisted. Do skip out on the other Vegas buffets and save your money for this one!\n\nHuuuuge selection of food. Main attractions were the prime rib, crab legs, crem brulee dessert, and the seafood. Even the Asian food taste legit (pad thai especially) and everything was cooked perfectly, like the egg benedict. I am impressed. We were lucky, because we came here around 2:45 for a late lunch but got to eat some dinner food because they came at 3:30ish... meaning we got lunch price for the food. Our server was friendly, but slow with the drinks... \n\n-1 star for being so pricy =\/ but I guess it's what you pay for. And three bathroom stalls. Are they trying to kill us?!
