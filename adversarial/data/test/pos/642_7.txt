My wife and I called to get pool service from this company. They don't work on the weekends and can't give you an appointment time. They can give you a 4 hour window for service and won't even give you a courtesy call 1\/2 hour before they arrive, like Sears would do. It must be so nice to have so much business in the month of December that you can't be more customer friendly. I'll just pass on using this company and give someone else the business.
