Pros: \n1. You can get into these apartments with as little as $90 down\n2. Location\n\nCons: \n1. Maintenance is a joke, nothing gets actually fixed and it takes forever for them to address any issues.  Forget about them giving you a time frame for an appointment or a call.\n2. Older than old appliances that do not work correctly or not at all and you just have to deal with it.  They will not repair noisy, rusted or half functioning appliances.  If it's performing at at least 25%, then you deal with it.  OLD and nasty AC units that waste hundreds of your dollars.\n3. Prices go up once they get you in so you end up paying more than other places that do charge a deposit.\n4. Apartments are not repaired or cleaned before you move in.  They will charge you for previous damages EVEN if you noted it on your walk in list AND you have pictures of the previous damages. \n5. There is no drop off box so if your move out day is Saturday or Sunday they will charge you for those days as you are not able to drop off the keys until the next business day.\n6. Dog feces everywhere and people with dogs of their leash.\n7. Parking is a nightmare.\n8. The police is called constantly to these apartments, there is a lot of vandalism.\n9. Walmart shopping carts EVERYWHERE.\n10. Mosquitos won't let you enjoy the winter here.  This place is infested.  \n11. The pools are constantly green or locked for repairs.\n12. Trash bins are usually overflowing and open.\n... I will be adding pictures supporting my statements and more info. as well.  Do not rent here if you are a decent individual or if you have a family.  This place is not nice, or safe.
