2's little harsh, it's more like 2.5.\n\nI smelled bleach as soon as I sat down at a booth near restroom. But that was only a warning sign.\nWhile my friends seemed to enjoy their omelet and benedict for brunch, my so-called Belgian Waffle suffered from a serious identity crisis. I want to know what was Belgian Waffle about it. \n\nWhat I got was a pale colored, flavorless slab with out-of can syrup\/juice immersed soggy mess. Wow, really. How could you do that to a plate of waffle?\n\nThe service was ok. Pleasant, but without a charm.\nThe place gets busier with after-church crowd on Sunday. So timing is a key.
