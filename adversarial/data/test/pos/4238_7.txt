Where do I even begin?! Came in with my two siblings and three kids - all under the age of 7.  Was told that there was an hour wait for a party of six when there were two empty tables right in front of us.  After suggesting he combine the two, the greeter (Taku?) said the best he can do is to separate us - three ayce at the bar and the three kids at a table.  Are you kidding me?  How much does a little common sense cost us now a days huh?  They're kids for crying out loud!\n\nWhy I decided to stay is beyond me.  The service here is painfully slow.  Ordered two chicken katsu combos and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the kids and seriously, it took them 15 minutes to come out with the miso soup alone!  You can just imagine how long it took them to come out with their food.   Also, the wait time for our sushi was just the same if not longer.  Seriously, waiting more than 30 minutes for food is just too much.  Chop, chop!\n\nSo ayce... You can't share food, I get it.  But when my 5-year-old nephew wants a bite of my ice cream, gosh dang it, he can have a bite of my ice cream.  The need for our server, Jean, to act like it's the end of the world is just crazy.  Relax girl, just charge me an extra $3, not a big deal.  \n\nThe service here could be much better.  Shame.  One star for the food and another for the all you can eat ice cream that comes with it.
