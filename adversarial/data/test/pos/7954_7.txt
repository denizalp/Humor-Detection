Please see their old yelp page that they are trying to run away from. The restaurant has not renovated they just don't want people to see all the negative reviews on there.\n\nThe old page has 38 fake reviews removed from yelp. There is a long list of poor management from the owner of this restaurant from Groupon scams to blaming the customer over basic complaints to stealing tips (my personal experience). Take a closer look at all the good reviews on here while some may be legit some are so fake over praising the restaurant and it's food.
