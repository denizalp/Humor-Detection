With all the hype Sprinkles gets, my expectations were overpriced (I figured about 6 dollars per cupcake) but really tasty cupcakes.  I was wrong on both accounts.\n\nWe arrived and chose the cupcake line.  There is a separate counter for ice cream and cookies.\n\nI was pleased the prices were reasonable. $3.00 for a cupcake is on par with less trendy shops.   I was disappointed that they did not have most of the flavors which were listed on the wall.  I settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini chocolate marshmallow for $2.00.\n\nThe chocolate marshmallow cupcake was horrible.  Neither my daughter nor I could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocolate topping with a strong bitterness.  \n\nThe raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting.  I could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness.  Unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rather crumbly.  It tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade.   The red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when I picked it up, the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground.  I am all for cupcake tops but this only happens with dry cupcakes. The flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three I would ever try again.
