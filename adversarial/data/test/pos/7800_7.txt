Do not go here if u have gluten allergies! The server was nice and tried to make up something for me without fish sauce  or soy sauce (gluten). All of a sudden  my gf gets up and starts yelling at the chef. Turns out the chef was talking trash about us in the kitchen in Thai \"why did they come here if they are so picky? I cant cook like that, tell them to go somwhere else\" she did not know my wonderful  angel speaks Thai lol... so we stormed out! \nI woukd give them 1 star but as a small business owner i know how hard it is to recover from a one star rating. I am giving them 3 stars for good karma only. If u are Vegan or have celiac do not go here. Food may be fine otherwise but we will never know. Lesson to all... u never know who speaks your language lol
