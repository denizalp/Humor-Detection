The OG. \n\nThis place is your classic diner spot located in a strip mall. Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.\n\nI highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty. \n\nThe omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft\/medium yolk. \n\nI would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat. \n\nBrunch proper my friends.
