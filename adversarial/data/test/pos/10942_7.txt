Came in Saturday for a breakfast burrito. They have never steered us wrong. We were excited to try out the new location. The previous location was very tight and not very enjoyable. This location in comparison is huge! They even have a full bar!\n\nYou enter into the lobby, and can order\/pick up takeout from here. You can also enter the dining area off to the right. You place your order at the bar, and the kitchen is directly behind this. There are a lot of tables, and many windows. \n\nWe split a bacon and chorizo breakfast burrito that was smothered in green chile. They were great and split it for us. The burrito itself was a disappointment. There were a lot of eggs, too many.  Not so much of the meat either. The bacon was limp. The chorizo was beef, and not too flavorful. It was not bad, but it was hard to find any in the burrito. The little bit of hashbrowns in there was done perfectly though. Nice and crispy. I really wish there were more of those and less eggs. The salsa...there was not depth of flavor at all. It was just heat. My husband, who cannot find any kind of salsa that is hot enough, said that it was too mild. For me, it was only heat. No real flavor. It needed some limes, maybe some salt and\/or sugar. Something. Really disappointed. \n\nBUT, we have had great breakfast burritos here in the past, so we have not yet given up. We will come back again, and give it another try since we like this location. And yes, there are PokeStops nearby!
