I'm not very impressed by this place. Maybe it's because $15 shouldn't be the least amount of money you have to spend in order to have a good burger. Maybe it's because a sack of $5 fries shouldn't be soggy after a two minute walk. Perhaps it's because I'm tired of places trying to sell me blue collar food at haute cuisine prices. Whatever the case, I've had better burgers at any of the diners that used to dot the landscape of king and queen west and I didn't feel like I'd been robbed after wards.\n\nMy burger was good quality meat but rather bland. The spicy fancy sauce is watered down mayo with the slightest hint of tabasco and was masked by the flavour of the bun. My fries didn't really seem all that fried but the french fried onions were really good.\n\nOn the plus side, this place does look very nice and the staff are incredibly friendly. I'm not a fan of the stools near the bar because they really aren't very comfortable but they look good.\n\nI know I'll probably be in the minority with my rating but seriously, with BQM, Craft burger, Jules, Avenue (yes, Avenue has a better burger if you're not looking for fancy eats) and I'm sure I'm missing a few more all within spitting distance, I can't see the appeal of m:brgr unless you're gullible enough to think that a Kobe beef burger is a good idea in the first place. That's just ruining good beef. That's like using a bottle of Screaming Eagle 92 for cooking.
