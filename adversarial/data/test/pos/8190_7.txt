At the risk of sounding too Humbert about it all, \"It was she who seduced me\".  That nymphette Lolita!  Mon cher chou and I were completely infatuated.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Delightful.  The mediterranean inspired menu offered so much.  We chose the chicken liver and roasted shrimp appetizers.  The livers were tender, with a crispy crust acommpanied by an insanely rich creamy polenta.  The shrimp had a great fire roasted flavor.\n\nMon Cher chou had the pork chop special.  Mercy, that was the best pig I have ever tried.  And I am a firm believer in the pig.  Tender like no other.  I had the veal shank.  That was fall off the bone tender and accompanied by a rich sauce.  The marrow was a decadent treat. The eggplant side was a nice greek\/italian melange,much like the chef himself.\n\nDessert was a chocolate pot de creme with salt and chantilly cream-- chocolate pudding for adults.  Oh yeah.\n\nThe drinks were really fun as well.  Each one bears a greek letter as a name.  I had the beta-- ginger infused vodka and soda.  It was like a very sophisticated ginger ale.  Mon cher chou had the eta--vodka, ouzo and something red.  Wooo, strong and herbal!\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  Still cool after all these years.  Low light, interesting art, moody, sexy atmosphere.   It's perfect for a first romantic date or a hundreth romantic date.  If you have the perfect date, all the better.\n\nTHE SERVICE:  Cool without being hipster.  Friendly and candid without TMI.  These foodies know their stuff.  They are required to try all the food (tough job, but someone has to do it) so they can really give an accurate and informative opinion.  \n\n\"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\"
