Over crowded, it had two levels, hip hop and edm type music. Both floors were crowded and the elevators to go down do not work unless you ask security so we stood there for a good 5+ minutes until security apologized.  Overall, it might be a club you could visit during the week but weekend is too crowded and it has too many obnoxious people. \n\nIf you get free entrance- be aware the drinks are super expensive\n\nMidori sour-16$ each\nVodka and red bull- 20$ (kettle one vodka) each\nAdios- 18$ each\n\nYou maybe free, but the drinks are crazy expensive
