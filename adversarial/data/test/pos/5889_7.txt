Put in in my mouth. \nPut in in your mouth. \nI said my big hungry mouth.\nI said your big hungry mouth. \nI just want to eat them all. \nYou will want to eat them all. \nCause all of those croissants just melt. \nAs soon as they hit your mouth. \n\nYou won't just need one. \nYou are going to need two. \nOr three, or four. Then you'll be coming back for some more. \n\nThis place is so good, stop wasting time reading Yelp reviews and go get in line. Buy everything you can get your hands on today.  This is where real craft and talent shine. And your personal preference is all up to your mouth & belly. Let your taste buds guide you. Just don''t make the mistake of not getting enough!  Strategize when you order. Things sell out quickly and you WILL get home and vividly fantasize about what had been in your mouth earlier in the day. Just order everything at once. What you will be shoving in your face right now. What you will be shoving in your face later. Possibly what you will want to be shoving in your face really, really later.  \n\nTrust me on this one.
