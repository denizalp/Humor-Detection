One of the worst dining experiences of my life . Hubby and I went there a week ago based on yelp reviews . We walk in and were ignored to be seated for like 10\nMinutes that should have been the sign but against the advise of my hubby I insisted to wait then the waitress finally seated us . Decor of the place is kinda cheapish but I thought who cares if the food is good. My husband ordered beer which 3 options weren't available so he opted with what was available. We ordered nachos to start they came without jalapeños and the waitress even made a comment like oh no jalapeños came oh well!!  The nachos were ok nothing to brag about . Then we wanted to order shrimp fajita for two and she said they Are out of shrimps weird.. So we ordered chicken and beef fajita for two . When it was finally served half an hour later I couldn't beleive it .. a small tray of sour cream and cheese and 3 fajitas was that suppose to be enough for both of us ?? The worst is that the chicken and beef were not edible so we didnt bother I was so livid at that point we just went up to the counter paid and left . Never will we ever return .
