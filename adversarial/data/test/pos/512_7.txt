This place deserves 5 stars. The food is absolutely great! The staff are nice and I can't find another breakfast place that compares.\nwise.\n\nI originally complained about this restaurant for the lack of space, and gave this 4 out of 5 stars. However, the owner took the time to contact me and let me know that there is already plans put in place to expand space and that this is simply a leasing issue. \nSo I am giving this place 5 stars, because it may currently suck to be outside waiting to get in...but it is worth it!
