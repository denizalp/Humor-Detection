With my frequent visits to Hawaii's 9th island, I've Yelped about food, drinks,and nightlife in Las Vegas. I'd be remised if I didn't mention the incredible gardens in The Bellagio!\n\nYou would never think of finding a most beautiful array of botanical life in the desert. Not only are there so many species, but the presentation is breathtaking. \n\nFive times a year, over 120 gardeners and horticulturists transform this glass atrium into tens of thousands plants, trees, and flowers. A dazzling array of colors, smells, and almost impossible creations abound. No wonder over 5 million visitors each year. \n\n24\/7 and it's free!
