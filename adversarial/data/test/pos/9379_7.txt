I've usually been here for brunch, and boy do they let the B team handle that. Service is inattentive but not terrible. Monkey bread is nice. Brunch entrees are hit or miss. The Crab Benedict, for example, had the least fresh crab I've ever tasted. \n\nOtherwise the drinks are strong, so that's a plus.
