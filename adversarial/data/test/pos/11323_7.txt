Never Again, Never Again. \n\nI Only came here thinking it would be better and faster than the Urgent Cares in town.\n\nThe wellness clinic is a waste of time. I saw a APN, not an MD and she misdiagnosed me and told me to take OTC meds for my sinusitis. She was nice but what's nice when you don't feel good and are misdiagnosed. \n\nI went home downloaded Dr on Demand App and saw a Doc Through FaceTime that was 100% better. I was diagnosed properly and given the prescribed meds for my sinus infection within 30 minutes. \n\nSo basically I wasted an hour of my day at the Wellness Clinic and $20 bucks and had no relief whatsoever. \n\nThanks for nothing Walgreens!!
