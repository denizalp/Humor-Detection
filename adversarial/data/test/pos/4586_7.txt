Soft, expensive meat; that's it!\n\nTook my parents for dinner this week and couldn't have been less impressed. The bill with tip was $300 without any wine, cocktails, appetizers, or lobster. \n\nI get that this place is vintage but it needs an update and flavor.  The salad, meat, and potatoes were very bland. The prime rib was very tender, but we had to cover it in extra seasoning, salt, horseradish, and juice to get any flavor. \n\nService was slow with the restaurant being less than half full. The salad and meat were prepared table side but you could tell they had done it a million times and put no effort into the experience, presentation, or plating. \n\nFor the price, I would have expected much more. This place isn't on the strip in a nice hotel but the prices didn't reflect that.
