A PUB WHERE THERE ARE NO WORRIES\n\n  The Auld Dubliner is a touch of Ireland situated in a lakeside Montelago Village in the Las Vegas desert. When you step inside Auld Dubliner Pub, an Irish pub awaits. From the wooden fixtures to the bar and tables, imported Irish furnishings are a touch away. When David Copley created the Auld Dubliner he gave Lake Las Vegas an authentic Irish pub. It is more than furnishings that bring Ireland to Lake Las Vegas. It is the drinks, beer, wine and pub food including burgers and fish & chips. \n\nThe Daniel S-pectation:\n\n    I walked into the Auld Dubliner to enjoy a cold one while watching sports before spending time outside along the Lake. \n\nMy experience of the Sunday, January 25 visit:\n\n   In similar style to today's Lake Las Vegas Montelago Village, this was one laid-back place. The majority of the patrons sat outside in the patio dining at the tables overlooking the Montelago Village. I was the sole bar patron. In the front of the house was a staff of two: the bartender and waitress. The waitress would complain to the bartender, who made the drinks in front of me, that certain customers were showing a lack of appreciation toward her job. She was a hard worker and personable to me. The bartender was really laid-back and attentive. His catch phrase was \"no worries.\" When a customer complained about a drink glass, he fixed the problem with a, \"No worries.\" When the waitress let off some steam, his response was, \"no worries.\" When he checked on me and I said everything was good, his response was, \"No worries.\" And when I drank my pint of PBR, there were no worries. \n\n  Being Lake Las Vegas, they charge Las Vegas Strip prices. I was only having one beer. I was content sipping a $4 pint of PBR while watching professional golf on the large TV screen. If it had been a Football Sunday, I might of taken advantage of a Carlsberg Game Time Special where a Bloody Mary, Jim Beam Stag shot, or Margarita is $5. Then again I'd most likely have stuck to a beer. In the daylight I'd prefer to be spending most of my time outside in the beautiful lakeside Montelago Village in the desert. \n\n  Now if I had been here at night, I might of spent a few hours in a less laid-back pub. Every night of the week there is a different event. Monday is kickball night. Tuesday is karaoke night. Wednesday is Gamer Night. Thursday is College and Ladies Night. Friday is Live Music Night. Saturday is DJ Dance Party Night. And Sunday is Service Industry Night. \n\nConclusion- 3 & 1\/2 stars:\n\n  With the main casino shut down at the time of this review, Lake Las Vegas is in want of a bar scene. Gradually this might be changing with Brooklyns planned to open across the walking path. Meanwhile, The Auld Dubliner is a nice spot to experience the joys of an Irish pub in the lakeside Montelago Village in the desert. Concerning if I will return here, \"No worries.\" \n\n   \n\n,,,
