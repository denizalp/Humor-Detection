I've been away from this gym for close to two years.  Dumb me, I let my much cheaper yearly membership fee lapse after they called a halt to the freeze I'd put on it.  Now I'm back and paying double, but happy to report that the place seems better than it did when I left.\n\nIn its last incarnation, the piped music blared way to loudly, interfering with the music I was trying to listen to through my earbuds, to the point that once time I needed to call the front desk from the treadmill I was on to get them to lower it.  This was always a problem, but now it's not.  Bravo!\n\nI like some of the new Hoist machines, and find that there are fewer older machines that are out of order and\/or rundown and shabby.  I also appreciate the addition of the smaller lockers on the second floor, handy for those of us who come from home rather than work, already dressed to work out and with no need to use the women's locker room.  They have built-in combination locks, and they're free.\n\nFinally, there are many more hand sanitizers around, and I've seen a few people using them.  Too few, alas, but they're there for us germophobles.  \n\nWhile I don't like having to pay twice as much as I used to, I'm happy to not feel as if I'm getting less instead of more.
