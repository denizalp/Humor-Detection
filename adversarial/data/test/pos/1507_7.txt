All these hype about Marathon Cafe's winning Milk Tea maybe hard to understand. \n\nThis newest Marathon Cafe in Richmond Hill though is one of the nicest Hong Kong Style Cafe to chill...\n\nIt operates more like a self serve coffee shop where you order and pay for your food, pick up your drinks and the food will deliver to your table.\n\nThis location is a lot more spacious than Scarborough. +0.5\n\nFree Wifi! and Chinese TV program for you to enjoy.\n\nFood is so so and with a limited menu. I wish my tea is served in a real \"HK Milk Tea Style\" cup...\n\nMilk tea quality can be a hit or miss... since the winner is not really at the counter and make that winning tea for you when you visit! \n\nCash Only!
