We were staying close to the Strip at the Tuscany  (which was excellent), and after seeing reviews decided to give Fremont Street a try. \n\nIt wasn't too long we got accosted by a lady who asked us some \"butter up\" questions and brought us to her souvenir shop where they tried to get us to listen to a 90-minute presentation to buy something which we didn't stick around to hear what it would be for.\n\nWe got a cheap prime rib dinner at Tony Roma's at a casino along Fremont Street. The prime rib was very good. After dinner, my wife went into the women's restroom where a lady came in and threw up all over the floor. We played a little on a slot machine and didn't win anything.\n\nThere are definitely an abundance of Creeps and Weirdos along Fremont Street, and a lot of panhandlers and homeless people.  I wouldn't recommend it and we won't be back. It's the type of place that makes you want to take a shower afterwards.
