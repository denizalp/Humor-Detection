On the advice of a friend I tried out Spice 9.  It being the first visit, we just went for the lunch buffet to try out a selection of items.  We could smell spices from the parking lot, in a good way.  The buffet provided a great quick lunch with lots of choices.   There were several tasty chutneys, including tamarind and a more unusual coconut.  The buffet selection included the Mughal staples:  rice, naan, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and vegetable curries, but there were also more homey Indian dishes like a yellow dal with green peppers, lamb curry, sambar and rasam, an eggplant dish,  and dry curries (just veg and spice without a heavy sauce).   The spicing seemed very authentic, and the level of heat was definitely higher than in the average Charlotte Indian restaurant.   It isn't \"take your face off\" hot -- if you're one of those people that think every meal is a chili pepper eating contest you might be disappointed.   The spice blends come out nicely and aren't dominated by the heat, and dishes that are supposed to taste different from each other and use different spice blends, actually do taste different.  I lived for a few months in India when I was younger, so I'm pretty picky about Indian restaurants.  This is one I'll go back to.  \n\nThe restaurant is located right across the road from Concord Mills just south of Lowe's.   The interior is nicely decorated and definitely has an upscale vibe, not like the usual strip-mall place.   Note:  disappointingly, the name of the restaurant is not a Vonnegut reference, although that does not affect the deliciousness of the food.
