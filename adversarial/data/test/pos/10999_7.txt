Not a big fan of burgers but I loved this place.\nI like how MANLY this place seems to be, if you want some burgers cooked by some real men, this is where you go. The people who cook it seem like they just came out from prison, I love it. \nThe only down side is that you have to have cash but with burgers like these, who cares?
