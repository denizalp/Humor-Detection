I'm basing this rating solely in comparison to the Flamingo location. Everything that location does wrong is 100% corrected in the N. Rainbow location. Luckily it's much closer to me as well as several other glaring differences.\n\nThe machines are spread out over a wider area and you don't feel like you are working out with hundreds of people. Not to mention everyone at this location is extra friendly on the staff. When I was at the Flamingo location it felt like I was being judged by all the staff members. It may have something to do with me being a string bean but screw them.\n\nIf you're looking for an intimate location where you don't feel like you need to beat back droves of people to get on a machine then head to the N. Rainbow location. If you prefer looking at plastic bimbos and juiceheads then head to the Flamingo location and wait 20 min. for a machine. Thank you for getting it right LVAC!
