I wish I could give this place less than one star. It was easily the worst experience of my life! \n\nLet me just start by saying that I had completely virgin hair. I had NEVER dyed it before in my life. I went here because my mother claimed it was a great place. It was very posh. They served me iced tea in a wine glass. I just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists. \n\nWendy, was younger than I was, and had an attitude with me from the start. I told her that I wanted to go light blonde (think lady gaga or christina aguilera). I'm a natural brunette. She instantly told me that it would look terrible and that she refused to do it. Then she continued to have every single stylist in the place back her up and tell me how stupid I was for wanting it. Finally she said she would do me a few shades lighter and since my mother suggested her, I decided to just go with it. Instead of making me a few shades lighter she proceeded to give me orange and yellow streaks in my dark brown hair.  Halfway through she started cutting and styling another womans hair (even though I had an appointment and she didn't.) I had to sit for about an hour reading (not under a dryer) while she finished up the other woman. By the time she was done with me I was devastated. She asked me what was wrong and i said \"Well it's not blonde enough and I don't really like highlights. I told you this.\" She took a piece of the yellow she made and said, \n\"THIS ISNT BLONDE TO YOU? ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS ISNT BLONDE!?\"\n\nThen took me around the entire salon and had every stylist tell me that it looked amazing and I was a \"hot blonde\". Every single stylist then told me how horrible what I wanted would have looked and that I should be thankful that Wendy did what she wanted instead of listening to me.\n\nI felt horribly bullied and left there 200 dollars poorer and covered in embarrassing orange and yellow stripes. I spent weeks wearings hats and headbands to cover up the horrible mistake. \n\nIt wasn't just the bad hair job, because I could have understood that. But it was the fact that she insulted me and bullied me the entire time and then proceeded to give me the opposite of what I asked for. Why didn't she just tell me from the beginning that she couldn't help me? It would have saved me the $400+ that it cost to correct the mistake she made.
