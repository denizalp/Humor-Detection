Very stunning hotel i wish i had stayed here! I will next time but i did come here for a little gambling and to enjoy the scenery. This is easily the best hotel on the strip. It's high end, very modern decor, and tight on security.  Feels great. \n\nThere's so much to see, the water fountains are beautiful! Everything is just stunning. There's hallways full of flowers and decor you've never seen before. Check out my pics!
