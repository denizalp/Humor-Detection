I cant believe my lease for my first Lexus is up already! WOW time flies when you're having fun. Well any-who after months of debating on what car I wanted next I decided to stay with Lexus. I upgraded from my IS 250 to the IS FSport! So beautiful and so fancy, I love it. Toddy again was fantastic. He helped me figure out what I really wanted, crunched numbers with me, went over detail after detail and go me in my new car. I was very nervous the first time in leasing because of all the horror stories you hear, but if you pay attention to your contract and actually care for your care while you are leasing, there really is not much to worry about. I went ahead and leased for another 3 years and when I turned in my old Lexus I had no problems. I was not over on my miles, the car was in good condition and the inspection company that came out to inspect the car before I turned it in, came to my work and performed the inspection free of charge. Trading in my lease was so easy, it was awesome! Definitely recommend leasing with Lexus of Chandler and make sure you ask for Toddy!!
