A few months ago, I noticed that this place would be opening soon since my husband frequents Freedom Firearms a few doors down. Been here twice so far and I am happy that we finally have a good ramen place near our house! My favorite is still in Chinatown, but this is a good option for days that we don't have time to drive down there. \n\nThe menu is similar to other ramen places - you get to choose your ramen and have the option to add additional toppings as well as extra noodles. They also have fried rice and fried noodles, appetizers and side dishes. So far I have tried the Shoyu and Miso Ramen. The Shoyu was good, but my favorite is the Miso because the broth was rich and very flavorful. I usually avoid drinking too much of any ramen broth for obvious reasons, but just had to take a few sips of this one since it was so good!\n\nService is excellent! The staff here are very friendly and attentive. They check up on you a few times so you can really tell that they care and want to provide great service. One drawback though, is that they don't have curry. I think a side curry bowl on the menu would be awesome! Definitely returning.
