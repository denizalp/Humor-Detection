My husband and I decided to get the wristband deal which allows you to eat at the buffet at the Luxor and at the Excalibur whenever you want until 10pm. It seemed like a good deal, $35 a person for what was lunch and dinner for us. We ate lunch at the More buffet. It was no Bellagio buffet but it wasn't bad. The orange chicken was the best thing out, and it was probably the best orange chicken I've had. There were some taquitos out that looked just like the ones I have in the freezer at home for the kids. The dessert was pretty good, we had some pannacotta and creme brûlée.  Overall the lunch was ok and so we were tricked into thinking that the dinner would be much the same. This was a total bait and switch on the Luxor's part as the dinner had things that tasted worse than the crappiest things I was forced to eat as a kid. The sausage was the same that they had out at lunch, I could tell because it was rock hard, and all the salad items and fried rice were from lunch. The sushi had no fish in it only cucumber. I guess because there is also a sushi place in the hotel, and don't want to compete? Not sure. The only redeeming item, the orange chicken, was nowhere to be found. I looked around and all I saw was disappointment. Overall, the dinner food tasted like failure and wasted money. Oh, and I almost forgot, the little hostess woman sat me and my husband at the smallest table, when there were open booths, and we are fairly tall. The paramedics were there treating some lady when we arrived as well; should have taken that as a sign and gone elsewhere. Why don't I ever read yelp BEFORE I blow my money?\nMuch gross\nSo waste\nSuch disappoint \nWow
