The Tea Lab is the holy grail for tea lovers. You're immediately drawn in by the wall-lined tins of flavors, and the friendly employees wear white scientist coats....after all, it is a lab. ;)\n\nYou don't even necessarily need to buy loose leaf tea in The Tea Lab. If you can spare a few minutes for a drink to be seeped\/made, they make wonderful teas to go, both hot and iced. I recommend the Pina Colada iced tea, which has an amazing, rich flavor of super fresh ingredients. They also vend high-quality tea accessories for the tea lover in your life, and there prices are extremely reasonable. If you are looking to buy tea, you can leave with 3-4 types of tea for less than $20! Also, make sure you take a few minutes to ask to smell the various tins of tea, and at least make your senses happy for a few minutes.
