A friend and I went to brown derby to enjoy what we hoped would be the best meal that we've had in a while.\n\nOur check ran to around $100 with two beers, two steaks, two lobster tails, potatoes, and calamari as an appetizer.\n\nThe waiter was good and prompt. He made sure everything was okay and checked for refills.\n\nAlthough cooked properly, the food was not really all that great. If I am in mentor and I want a $20 steak I will go to longhorn. Their food is just better. Everything at the brown derby was relatively bland.
