Pretty frustrated by today's experience. I've been coming to Zipps for probably over a decade and I'm just beyond annoyed. \n\nFirst, I walk in and the waitress\/hostess said sit wherever you want. Ok cool. The place I wanted to sit had grease marks all over the seat. I asked the hostess if she could clean the seat as I'm not going to sit in a dirty booth. She looked at me like I was an idiot. So I said fine I will sit in another booth. \n\nThe waitress comes over and I ask for menus even though it's happy hour I still might want something else. She comes back and I run to the restroom. There is no freakin soap in either one of the dispensers. Who knows what employee didn't wash their hand and everyone else in there and for how long it was like that is unknown. That's crazy to me. So I told someone and no sense of urgency and didn't even say thanks. Why the heck do I have to tell you how to run your ops?\n\nSo me and my buddy we get an app and wings. We get the food with nothing. No napkins, no utensils. Why do I have to ask for normal things like napkins??? We get the wings and yep we got napkins then no freakin wipes. Usually when I go they have them with several wipes and you don't have to ask. Had to ask for wipes. I might be nitpicking all this but it's just basic to me. \n\nThe food was ok the wings were fine. 3 of my wings were overdone and literally burnt. So burnt and dried out one of bones broke off as I was peeling the meat away. Nothing to run home and rave about and I hate leaving a negative review but not being clean and mediocre bar food that used to be fairly decent just tilted me out. \n\nMy reviews on food are about an experience no matter where I go. I choose to spend my money at a specific establishment then I don't think it's out of line to have a tad bit of expectations. \n\nI'm torn on coming back here when there are so many other spots.
