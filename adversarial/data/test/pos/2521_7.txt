We dropped in only because we saw Shangrila nearby catch fire, so that was closed. We were quite happy with this place.\n\nIt had good food and great service. This is a casual and simple place so don't expect anything fancy. But the chili chicken and momos were good, and the service was really friendly. They were quite helpful. There's also a nice little patio for when the weather's looking good.
