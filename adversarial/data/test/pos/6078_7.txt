If I could give them 0 stars, I would. You pay a mandatory resort fee of $15 a night that supposedly goes to pool, internet access, parking, fitness center. Their pool is closed until April (not like I would use their dirty pool anyway), parking is impossible to find,  the internet is spotty. Now I have to visit the nasty fitness center to get my $15 worth of this stupid resort fee. I just hope I don't contract anything from the machines. Look, I don't mind paying a resort fee if I feel like I am getting something out of it. In other places I paid higher resort fees and I had access to an amazingly clean fitness center, a great pool, good internet service and hassle free parking. \n\nNever staying in this lame hotel ever again. The only reason we made the mistake of staying here this time was because it was a last min trip and it was the cheapest option, and we were trying to save a few bucks. I would have paid a bit more per night to save ourselves from the nasty smoky smell, the gangs of people that look like the dregs of a reality show, really thin walls, dirty rooms, shitty view, and dumb mandatory resort fee. On top of that when I asked the front desk about the resort fee and why I had to pay for it if one of these facilities were closed, she literally laughed and with an attitude, corrected me to tell me that it isn't an optional fee and that it is part of the hotel fee. Wow. I am glad she knows the difference between mandatory and optional. that wasn't my question.
