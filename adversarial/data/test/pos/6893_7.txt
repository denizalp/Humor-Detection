Dr. Schwartz and the entire staff at Pima Dental are awesome!\n\nAfter my move back to the Valley, I took my time in finding my new dentist... so after almost a year since my last DDS appointment, I finally got my act together and chose Dr. Schwartz and his practice at Pima Dental after narrowing my list down to four.  My choice was a bit more complicated since I do not have dental insurance... so I needed a dental office that was willing to work with me a bit to make the cost reasonable.\n\nAfter my second visit, I can now state with confidence that I made an excellent choice with Pima Dental!  \n\nOn my first visit, I received an extremely thorough cleaning.  I mean, it was seriously the best cleaning that I have ever had!  After two cleanings per year for many years, that means this was a really good cleaning!\n\nFor my second visit, I had an old filling that needed to be removed and replaced.  After discovering that the tooth was actually cracked on the side (most likely from the old filling expanding), Dr. Schwartz was able to work his magic and repair it instead of having to do a much more expensive (and much more painful) root canal.  My wallet and my mouth are extremely grateful!  \n\nBe sure to grab one of their putters and check out the mini golf course out back!\n\nI would recommend Dr. Schwartz and his team to anyone looking for a practice that does fantastic work, yet still provides plenty of patient face time with the Dr. \n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
