I had two services from this company, which it was extreme pricey.  The first service in April 2016, the garage door wasn't able to come down due to off track.  So the company came to replace left side track for $922.00. I found this company in the internet.  When they gave me the quote, I was shock but wasn't able to find other company to fix since the garage door needed to be closed ASAP.  So, I had to use them since they was already out there.\n\nThe second service was in June 2016, the same situation, the garage door wasn't able to come down.  Since I didn't live in Las Vegas, I asked them just pull down the door without fixing it.  They charged me $175 just pulling down the door.\n\nWhen I came to Las Vegas to fix the garage, I called another company, Vantage Garage Doors, this company came to fix the door in the hot Saturday afternoon for only $80.\n\nVoted for Vantage Garage Doors company with 5 stars instead of this pricey and ridiculous garage company\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter my above post, the owner called me for over 20 minutes to argue that is the right price when his competitor can fix the garage door for less $100.\n\nHe also made up the execuse how bad the damage the tenant made because I wasn't there in his reply comment below.  I want to say BECAUASE I wasn't there to watch your staff doing, that's why I got rip-of just fixing garage for $922 and then for the second time service, all the warranties as promised at the first time service for such high price didn't cover.  End up, I had to pay $175 for pulling the garage door down without fixing.  \n\nLater, when I discussed with my agent, friends in Las Vages and its competitors, all of them  commented this company is very expensive.  Especially, if you are out of state to call for service like me,  WATCH OUT!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe owner changed his comment right away once reading my the second comment above.  Took out because I wasn't there...... Address \"quality\" reason to support his pricy.....\n\nWow, the owner and I start comment war just like the ping pong, forward, backward, forward, backward... From that, you can see what kind of the management style is!  Can you believe this company?  I will leave this question to the readers.  Enough for me!
