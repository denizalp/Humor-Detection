Yuck...\n\nAlright I don't complain about much...No really!! Check my posts... it could be construed I am overly positive... That's why this place needed to be reviewed, because I can't be positive about this place. Not even a little... Here is why:\n\nSo I get into a little fender-bender and I drop my car off to get it fixed by the insurance company. I pick literally the closest place to the shop because well all car rental places are the same eh? \n\nNot so my friend... I have never seen a more ghetto, backroom operation in my whole life.\n\nSo the place is in this non-descript dirty little building in an industrial area in Tempe. That is nothing to bitch about but the dingy little office INSIDE...frankly made me want to take a shower.\n\nThere is one person doing everything and it took over an hour to be out the door with the car.\n\n The car I got was not washed. It smelled like someone smoked in it for weeks with the windows rolled up and left burning cigarettes burning in it while they were sleeping at night. \n\nThey knew it was through insurance , so I am not sure why they gave me a car that was more than ANY insurance would actually pay leaving me with a bill of over 200 bucks after the insurance. \n\nThere was a snag with my insurance initially which has nothing to do with them... but I did get a call from them after I turned in the car, asking me to pay again ( after I paid out of pocket) ... apparently there is no office memos or communication in that office.\n\nYeah that's it...but for as something as simple a renting a car they sure managed to make it a spectacular screw-up, and probably the worst experience I have ever really had renting a car. I would certainly look to other places if you are forced to rent in that neighborhood.
