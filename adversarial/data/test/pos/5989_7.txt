I first dined at Todd's a week ago and I've been back twice since!  It might be a bit soon to make this call, but I am going to go out on a limb and declare it to be my overall favorite off-strip restaurant in Vegas.  Blows away Rosemary's.\n\nTodd serves creative, well executed, high-quality food made with fresh seasonal ingredients combining both subtle and bold flavors,  I suppose some might say there is Asian influence, but I consider it to be West Coast American Nouveau.  I must admit, however, that this review might be slightly biased because it is soft shell crab season and I am sort of a soft shell crab whore.  \n\nBesides the juicy, succulent, makes-my-mouth-water-just-thinking-about-it soft shell crab, everything I've had there has been surprisingly good.  On a couple occasions I've even caught myself chuckling out loud about an unexpected twist or an extra added touch which took the dish to the next level.  \n\nOne example would be the time I ordered what the menu that day called surf and turf - day boat scallops and tournedos of beef .  I ordered scallops rare and they were prepared exactly how I like them.  The tenderloin was well cooked, properly seasoned and balanced out with the scallops nicely.  However what took the dish to the next level in my opinion was the attention to detail found in the veg served on the plate.  Squash, beautiful broccoli, perfectly cooked enoki mushrooms, fresh green beans, and to top it off (and what made me chuckle) was a 2 inch piece of delicious, sweet corn still on the cob.  Nice touch.\n\nI won't go into detail about their must-order signature Kobe short rib, but  I will tell you they braise it for three days to create unparalleled tenderness.\n\nThe service at Todd's is top notch.  Besides being attentive and well versed on the menu and the cooking techniques used, the servers are very nice and not afraid to engage in some friendly conversation.  In my opinion one of the keys to good service is making the customers feel comfortable and they certainly achieve that here.\n\nWith the kind of food and service one might expect from a white tablecloth restaurant, it is refreshing to be served in a more cozy, relaxed environment.  There is a no-smoking bar on one side of the restaurant that has a bit of an old-fashioned feel to it but then they've got the basketball playoffs going on the TV. \n\nTodd is an actual person (chef\/owner) and from what I can tell he is there most nights and makes an effort to come out on the floor and interact with the guests, another nice touch.  \n\nI'm glad to have discovered this gem and it's already become a new weekly spot for me in spite of being clear across town from me.
