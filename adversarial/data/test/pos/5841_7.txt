I went to watch the opening night of Julius Caesar as part of the Shakespeare in High Park program.\n\nThe amphitheatre is absolutely stunning. Despite being out in the open, the acoustics are quite good. What an experience- watching Shakespeare under the night sky, with balmy weather and chirping birds. \n\nI really liked the modern rendition of Julius Caesar. It was witty, smart, full of depth, yet still true to Shakespeare's script. \n\nMake sure to bring some cushions if you did not buy a Premium ticket. Being outdoors, the downside is that you are sitting on the ground. It could be quite uncomfortable, especially for a 2 hour show. \n\nGreat cast, amazing interpretation and phenomenal setting.\n\nOh, and shout out to the woman who went on stage, stripped off her bra and yelled \"I'm 50 and free\".
