The four stars is for the nice lady that tried to help me find a gift bag for booze that I had purchased at a different liquor store. She searched high and low for something that it could fit in to, but wasn't successful. It's not her fault, they just don't carry it.\n\nBut minus one star for the snooty guy that tried to come along and \"help,\" by saying that Crown Royal doesn't even come in a box. I just bought it from another liquor store. In a box.
