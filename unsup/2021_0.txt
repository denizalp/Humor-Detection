My husband and I ordered $40 worth of food through postmates. About 10 minutes After we placed the order my husband got a message saying our order was cancelled because cafe zupas was \"too busy\" . Also on the postmates app it says cafe zupas excepts orderes until 830pm and we ordered at 630. If they're too busy to take our money, we can gladly take it somewhere else ;-)
