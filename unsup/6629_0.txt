This club should be renamed DXS... because the only thing it has an excess of is douchey-ness.\n\nA totally un-original club, where the only highlight was the pool no one was allowed to swim in. The music was okay. The line to get in was ridiculously long (waited over an hour). The hotel\/ club staff were incredibly rude. The cover was overpriced, the drinks were overpriced, and the club was wayyyy overcrowded.
