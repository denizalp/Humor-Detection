What a wonderful and relaxing experience! This spa is definitely 5 star service and professionalism! I checked out Scottsdale Spa's and Heidi, the owner, got back to me so quickly on Yelp. When I called, I also spoke with Karen who was very accommodating and expedient. Upon arrive we were greeted with open arms and a very welcoming environment. Thank you very much everyone!!
