I have been here a few times, no complaints.\nBut today, the line was almost out the door for lunch. They had 6 people working the front counter to insure each step was done in a timely fashion. It was quicker than a fast food drive through and my chicken burrito bowl is delicious! I love that Chipotle is an inexpensive option for a healthy meal. Everyone there seemed to enjoy their job also. I will be returning for lunch again soon.
