If you want REAL Carolina's, you need to go to the location On Mojave and 12th st.\n\nYES, its ghetto, BUT its the original, its a hole in the wall...and its the best!!!\n\nI have been there more times than I can count,in the three years I have lived in the valley.\nI have never once been unhappy with the food.\n\nAnd my Harley has never been stolen, and my Challenger still has all its wheels :)
