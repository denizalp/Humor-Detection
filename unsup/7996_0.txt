How can I write a review when I'm speechless?  OMG.  This store is GORGEOUS and STUNNING in every way.  Regardless if you are in the market to buy furniture, I would say it's definitely worth a trip just to see the view from the 4th floor patio.  All that was missing was a glass of wine and the fire pits lit up.  I left feeling inspired.  Kudos to RH on this flagship store.  Kudos.
