So you think you can get in easily with pre-sale tickets?  Think again.. be prepared to pay off those greedy bouncers $20 extra for their \"express\" line.  Oh you don't have cash because you went during the night swim night?  Well too bad, they're going to make you wait 2+ hours in line no matter how full\/empty the club is.\n\nI still love the club, but the bouncers need to go.  See my pictures of those assholes for more detail.
