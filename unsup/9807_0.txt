Located next to hardees. I drove pass and had to turn around. Its a food truck! Quick, great prices and quality food. There is nooooooo where in Charlotte yiu can get 10 wings for $5 nowhere and they taste good. Excellent customer service and friendly smile. U can call in the order for quick pickup or walknup to the window then wait in your car or sit at the picnic table.
