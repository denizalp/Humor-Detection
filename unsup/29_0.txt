This is a hidden gem inside the Gold Coast Casino. Claude, the owner, is fantastic! He gave me exactly the haircut I told him I wanted, while entertaining me with stories of his 30 plus years as a barber, his life in his native London and his trip to Spain. He even trimmed my goatee at no charge! The prices are from the 70's,too! He is a delightful person with mad barber skills. If you want a \"proper\" barber shop haircut, go and see Claude. Highly recommended.
