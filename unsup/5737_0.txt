Delicious treat hidden in an obscure and mostly empty strip mall.  The presentation was gorgeous and the food was delicious.  A friend of mine did the Omakase for $90.00 and basically received a tasting of the menu's highlights including foie gras, bone marrow, salmon belly ceviche and others!  I had the surf and turf which gave you the choice of prawns or scallops for the surf and lamb chops or steak for the turf, I got the steak and scallops both of which were cooked perfectly and accompanied by a delicious and innovative sauce.
