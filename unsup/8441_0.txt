I used to live in Montreal for years where French croissants and bakeries were easily found but the almond croissant never matched the one I tasted from La gourmandine today. The pastry was so fluffy and not terribly sweet with a subtle lasting flavor. My kids loved their chocolate eclair and choux creme. I highly recommend this bakery. Great service to boot.
