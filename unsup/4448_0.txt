Nothing really stood out except for the cute pig logo on the restaurant's banner. \n\nThe service was slow since the place was packed. (Not sure if it's due to the Groupon deal offered) \n\nThe meat was pretty dry and lacking in sauce. \n\nExtremely noisy and poor ventilation system. \n\nNope, won't be back.
