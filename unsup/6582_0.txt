Can I give ten stars? No? ONLY 5? Outrageous. I would give them 100 if I could.\n\nI have been coming here for probably 30 years. Nothing has changed, and I hope it never does. The best barbecue chicken in the city, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Fries are incredible. The cole slaw is wicked. And that bbw sauce! I'm a fan of the regular sauce but you can also ask for \"wing\" sauce instead if you like that tangy stuff better. I can't wait to come back.
