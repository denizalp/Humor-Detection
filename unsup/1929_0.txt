I pretty surprised at some of the mediocre reviews.  I had a very pleasant dining experience at Zebra.  Yes, it is pretty pricey, but it is a nice place to go to for a special occasion or a romantic date night.  The food was one of the best I've had in Charlotte so far and the service was top notch.  Perhaps the restaurant, like most, has its good and bad moments. Luckily, I dined during a good one.
