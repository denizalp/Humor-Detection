My husband and I came to the Salon with tired and aching feet. We were received by friendly smiles and warm hellos. \nFabuleux Nail Spa is immaculately clean from the ceiling to floor.  The musical ambience relaxes you as the Spa technicians Donna and Hanna massage all of your aches away. When you visit ask for Chase,  he is personable and very cheerful in keeping one amused.
