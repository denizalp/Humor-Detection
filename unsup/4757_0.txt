This place is awful, a total dump.\n\nYou'd have better luck going to the grocery next door, grabbing one of those nasty frozen \"TV dinners,\" throw it in the freezer for a year, make sure it gets freezer burn, then microwave it up...and it would still taste better than anything this place serves up.\n\nTheir poultry, foul.  A few times it tasted uncooked (yes, I made a giant mistake of giving this place multiple chances).  The rice, horrendous take on saffron rice.\n\nMy favorite was the menu's that had the street and town names spelled wrong :-)
