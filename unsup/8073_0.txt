Have a wide variety to suit your need but they are quite expensive...bought an orchid (22$) and another small indoor plant + 2 small pots for the plants and that summed up to 100$! If you go during summer on a hot day it might be too humid and unbearable in there so pick your time wisely ;) Also, if you are going for an orchid you can get one with 2 stems for the same price. The staff are helpful and will gladly assist you and recommend plants based on your preferences.
