1.  Katsu addon for mini rice bowl is $2.00.  They charged me $2.75 for \"Pork Belly Bao.\"  \n2.  Found hair in my mini rice bowl.  No it was not mine.  \n\nDon't get scammed out of your 3 quarters for parking meters.  \n\nIt would be a zero star but I will add 1 star for their lit business card.  Cheers!\n\nUpdate:  Henry F, the owner has messaged me personally to show his inexperience handling bad reviews, or people in general.  What a shame :\\
