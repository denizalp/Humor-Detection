The food was great, same great food as the rest of the locations. My problem was with the guy who seemed to be the manager-he was not very friendly and was actually kind of rude. My only complaint with Potbellys besides this manager is their lack of a kids menu. I'll probably go to the Scottsdale location in the future. They were very friendly at that location.
