Guy Fiery needs to disassociate his name from this place. We drove 45 minutes to eat here and it was a waste. I've never eaten sausage that just falls apart and had brisket that was too rough. Only thing that was good was the Kraft box Mac and cheese my kids ate.  Not impressed and never going back.
