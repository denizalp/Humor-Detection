The pool is kind of novel, but meh, it was OK.  If you have a club oriented around a pool in Vegas, how about hiring some dancers to get the crowd going INTO the pool?\n\nThe crowd is beautiful as is expected for the Wynn\/Encore crowd.  If only the promoters and the club owners can learn how to elevate rather than exploit the guests with high-priced cocktails.  It'll buy more good will and better reviews.
