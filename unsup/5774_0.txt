Not really my cup of tea.   I was told it was like chop house but the only similarity is that they sell food and healthy drinks.   They are really over priced and the food size is small.   I had the Carne as asada which was tasty but $25 for a sandwich and drink is way too much.   It just felt snobby.   Considering where it is located I should have guessed what it would be like.
