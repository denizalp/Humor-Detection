This place is great to cram 10 of your friends in. We got a 2 bedroom 2 bath and fit in fine. Its got a great location (right behind Barbary Coast! not gonna call it by it's new name... Who's Bill!?)\n\nIt was kinda dirty. The couches were stained and whenever I stay here, I get very itchy. Floors and vile and don't even try to walk barefoot around here, you might get an STD. \n\nThis place does its job, just don't come expecting Bellagio quality.
