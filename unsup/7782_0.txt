Shocked to find a Dean & Deluca in of all places Charlotte, NC.  Has the usual assortment of sandwiches, salads and gourmet coffees.  A little light on the assortment of interesting snacks, but in a city where most things are battered and slathered, a welcome change.  It gets busy at lunch time so try to be there before noon.
