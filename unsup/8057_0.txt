A stretch to Call this place new, but the grounds are breathtaking w\/ the mountain views, and they do an excellent job up-keeping the property!  This is probably one of the biggest hot tubs in a resort I have ever dipped in.  The pools are relaxing and fun to spend time at.  The rooms are cozy and big. Southwest-inspired designed flair,  Well put together spot.  You don't ever need to leave, but incase you do they have outstanding eating choices just minutes away! \n\n*Weddings\n*conventions\n*Family \n\nSometimes at night the second pool is a ghost town!
