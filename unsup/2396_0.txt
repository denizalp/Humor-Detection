Dear Flo,\n\nYou promised you'd be out here to visit me with an adjuster in two days.  It's now day three, and I'm starting to think you don't love me anymore.  I hate to act all needy, but since the storm, both my cars are crushed under a tree in my driveway, and I need to see you right away, baby.  Please call me and let me know that you are safe and on your way.\n\nAlways your sweet policyholder,\n\nKen\n\nXOXOXO
