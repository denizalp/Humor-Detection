Awesome place.\n\nStarted off with the Cherry Bombs, which are tomatoes stuffed with cheese and chorizo and then wrapped in a wonton and fried. It was different but a really good and savory starter.\n\nMy husband ordered the ribeye medium rare. It was fatty and dull of flavor, and SO tender. It was topped with this tomato basil mixture that was amazing.\n\nI ordered the veal chop medium rare with a creamy truffle mushroom sauce. WOW it was so good. The potatoes in the side were perfection.\n\nCreme brulee for dessert and it was just okay. Nothing special. \n\nWill definitely be going back.
