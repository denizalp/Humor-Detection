What a terrible experience!  I brought them two rifles for minor gunsmithing (scope alignment and installation of a swivel for a sling).  After two weeks they had not even got to them saw yet!  I went in to pick them up and their excuse was that the gunsmith was on vacation.  It would have been nice had they told me that when I dropped them off.  to and insult to injury they then charged me $30.00 to get my rifles back!
