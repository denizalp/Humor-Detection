For an oldster I was a little reluctant to saunter in - I mean what if someone sniffed at my wrinkled khaki shorts and Napa winery cap and my big boy Velcro sandals??  But no, I was swept in the milieu as if a seasoned regular - so welcoming.  My wife was even more reluctant to split open the heavy velvet drape entrance, but she too was caught up in the ambience.  Mission accomplished!!
