THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY!!! Beware, if you receive a bill that looks like an invoice for your business domain name on the internet.  Seems like a  real invoice until you read the fine print and realize that they are trying to sell you internet marketing.  However, they make their invoice appear as if you need to pay for your business domain name to be up an running, and I'm sure some unsuspecting small and large businesses probably pay this bill.  DO NOT PAY THIS AND REPORT THEM TO THE NEVADA DISTRICT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
