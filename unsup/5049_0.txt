These guys suck. You can see that they are straining to be like , the \"high fidelity records\" of anime and manga in Toronto, but to be frank they really just don't have the chops. They know their product decently, but if you want to pull of the attitude you better REALLY bring it. They don't. \n\nFrankly they don't have anything I can't get at any of a dozen other places in the city, they are overpriced, and their customer service sucks. I would suggest avoiding this place like the plague.
