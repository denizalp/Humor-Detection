Best club in town. Twist appeals to ANY crowd- gay, straight and everybody in between. The drag shows are an absolute entertainment. The alternative club scene is a little lacking in the city but goddamn, Twist is overflowing with happiness and good times. \n\nNo cover. Friendly staff. Cheap coat check. Reasonably priced drinks. And glitter... everywhere. \n\nOutstanding! Great work, guys.
