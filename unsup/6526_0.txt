Decent Japanese restaurant\n\nThe price is reasonable, and the food quality is pretty good. The dishes are decorated extremely well, especially the unagi don, which was served on a traditional-looking bento box topped with extra unagi and sauce. The gyu beef don was also decorated in a very appealing way, with big portions.\n\nThe service was a little slow though--it took a long while before we could order, and the wait staff seems very reluctant to work there.\n\nIn any case, all in all this is a decent place for Japanese food!
