There are 2 pools at the Cosmo and this one is on the 14th floor Chelsea Tower. This one is the more chill adult pool with a rectangular hot tub. It faces the Aria.\n\nShow your room key and you're in. Grab your towels and enjoy. Pool water isn't the warmest, but it is lightly heated.\n\nTo the left if this pool entrance is a cute pet relief area.
