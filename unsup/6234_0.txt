Great place to bring kids. There's a private room with storytelling and other kiddie activities. You can check out their schedule online: http:\/\/lvccld.org\/about\/branch_info.cfm?id=26. The whole library is bright, clean, and environmentally friendly. I thought it was going to be a lot bigger, but half of the building is used for administrative offices and other functions. Still, it's worth it to bring the kids down, check out books, CDs or DVDs.
