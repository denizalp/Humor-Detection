Lived in the high rises on Thorncliffe Park for about 11 years, only blocks away from EYTC. This mall was reasonably good during the Zellers and BiWay days, however those are long gone. Rent is so much, stores just can't stay open. Dominion turned into Food Basics and this particular location is the most disgusting I've ever seen. \n\nCrummy stores, only place crowded here is the walk-in clinic. Even McDoald's closed shop and ran off. Wish they'd shut this mall down.
