Oh man this spa was good and super relaxing.  We came in and was greeted promptly.  We checked in and waited by the waiting area.  The spa facilities is nice and relaxing and they provide juices, water, coffee and some snacks.\n\nMy massage was the best and I didn't want it to end! It was sooooooooooooo good and relaxing.\n\nHighly recommend.
