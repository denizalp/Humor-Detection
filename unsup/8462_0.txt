Best...wings...ever!!!   Arizona smoked wings are smoked in mesquite wood making them smokey and fall off the bone awesome!  I got them with honey, bbq, hot  and parmesan.  The honey for sweet, the bbq for tang, the hot for a spivey kick and the Parmesan for texture and tang!  Add all that to those smokey wings and you have the best wings ever made by man!   A bit high on the price for the wings but they are SOoooooOooOo worth it!   The waitress was super nice and at tentative.
