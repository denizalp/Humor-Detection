Probably my worst birthday dinner experience ever. Went with my family for my birthday. Ordered chicken stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella. When we received the dish it was swimming in water (probably microwaved). The chicken was chewy and tasted old. The prosciutto and mozzarella was nowhere to be found. I emailed the company and they said a manager will call me but that never happened. The bathroom had pictures of naked kids. The prices are ridiculously high and the quality the worst. I used to love Buca but now I'm totally disgusted.
