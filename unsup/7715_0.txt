This has been a favorite place of my wife and I's. They were doing good but were having staff problems and wait times were getting long. They have recently changed out most of their staff and the service is very much improved. So I have to give credit for a responsive management who will do something about problems so I wanted to share this information with the public.\n\nDon't forget to get the bang bang shrimp is fantastic and the bowls are very good as well as the grilled steak. \n\nThanks again,
