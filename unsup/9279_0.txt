The first time I ever got my lashes done I came here (big mistake) paid ridiculous amount of money over 200 dollars to have all my lashes fall out within 2\/3 days.the worst part I called the next day to tell them half already had fallen out they told me to come back they fixed and still didn't stay on my lashes. The girl was awful to say the least... I will never spend a penny at cherry lash lounge again. I RECOMMEND SASSY LASHES IN HENDERSON. AMAZING PLACE.. Check it out :)
