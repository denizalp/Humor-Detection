Pat Catan's is pretty sweet. \n\nThey have everything for any type of artsy craftsy type of thing you want to get into.\n\nYarn for knitting. Paint for painting. Canvas for painting on. Brushes to dip in paint. Needles for sewing. Frames for framing. And they even do custom framing - but I've never used that service. \n\nTheir prices are very low and pretty much every time I go to the register everything is even cheaper than what it was originally marked. \n\nBest thing? They're locally owned. That's more than I can say for Michael's.
