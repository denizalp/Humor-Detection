I was excited to eat here. I was told so much about this place. I even took pictures. This sucked dont waste your time. They use some nasty white cheese that taste sweet. Last I checked cheese is not sweet. They fried ice cream was so nasty it was not fried at all. The place was clean but the chicken was dry and ewww I wont return to this location. But to sit and chill and drink a lil bit its ok but not to eat see I will eat from someplace else.
