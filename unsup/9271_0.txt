Tried two of the decorative soaps (donuts- of course!) as take home gifts for kids. They have different skin types, though both reacted to them. \n\nHowever the company's service rep was very kind in expressing her concern when I called to inquire. They took care of it and sent a couple gratis items for us to give another try. The hand scrub is terrific. \n\nIn closing: Their product looks incredible, so it's tempting for the kiddos. I'd proceed cautiously if you have sensitive skin, or are shopping for young kids.
