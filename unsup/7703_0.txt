A UofI alum took me here when I was 20 and itching to go to 19+ bars. We hit this place up first, as it is apparently quite a popular place. I was disgusted, and even more so when my alumni, a former PKA told me he and his brothers peed while in their chairs at the bar.\n\nThe place stunk. The drinks were worse and painfully weak. I was horrified to see people in formal wear. Guess they were pre-gaming it there?\n\nLadies...pass this one up. You can do better!
