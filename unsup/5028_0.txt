Just happen to buy a Nike Fuelband at the Niketown store at Cesars Palace and the sales clerks mentioned to go to the Apple Store to use the fast wifi to download the Nike Apps. Just like most Apple Stores, sales clerks are helpful and didn't mind me hanging out for a while do use their wifi. There were two lady clerks that were accomodating, kept me entertained, and showed features of Nike Apps. Helpful and great staff. Will propably come back to town soon and drop by and maybe buy a new Iphone here soon.
