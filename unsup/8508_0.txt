I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.\n\nI think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and \"mexican cheese blend.\"\n\nPlus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.  \n\nShut this place down.  You're done.
