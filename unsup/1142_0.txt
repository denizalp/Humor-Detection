Went in for an oil change. Kasie started helping me out and she was super nice, got me checked in quickly. Nick took over afterwards and helped me diagnose a problem in my car that had been bothering me, without charging me just cause he had extra time. I even offered to bring them some pizza as thanks, since they didn't charge me, but they just said \"that's what they do!\" It was great. Love them.
