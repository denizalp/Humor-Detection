We just went there and they make you pay up front but also force a 12% tip up front too.  What?!  That's some nerve.  Not one waiter talked to us and we couldn't order a drink.  They didn't even bring water to the table.  My true tip would be $0.00 but we've been scammed.  The food was meh with minimal to moderate selection, though some dishes were lukewarm\/cold.  Also, they ran out of rice for the rest of the night.
