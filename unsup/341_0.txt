Went to Luxy's for a friends 20th birthday. Enjoyed it.\n\nThe security took 5-10 minutes finding our host's name on the guest list.\n\nWe got there a little late, and the girls my friend and I were with did not get in free.\n\nThe club has free parking which is a huge plus, although the place was way too crowded to even move in.\n\nThe music wasn't bad and we ended up drinking the whole night.\n\nOverall an average experience.\n\n3\/5 - I would recommend this to a friend.
