It's unheard of to be in the presence of amazing dentists without feeling like you're getting pocket raped. I started coming here about a year and a half ago and wouldn't change it for the world. Extremely gentle and honest about what you need. There are a few different dentists in the office, but all have a great sense of humor and make your stay a bit more comfortable. Sheila is a great hygienist, and Dr. Van and Dr. Farrell go above and beyond for patients.
