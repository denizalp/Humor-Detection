So this is the better Paramount location from my humble opinion. It's pretty standard as far as Arab food is concerned but I really enjoyed the hummus here. I would return if they kick it up a notch - this is what happens when you have a client base relying on you for a quick turnover and ample selection. \n\nDeff worth a visit yo'.
