I come thru the drive thru a few times a week and must say..these are the nicest employees..Richard and Hassan have worked there FOREVER.. and are friendly,knowledgable and get people thru the drive thru quickly. For the room they have to do business..they do a great job..Richard always makes a point to ask me how I'm doing and has a sincere smile on his face...
