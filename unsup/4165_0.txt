Pretty much the most average place on The Main, but that plays to its charm. It's got eggs, it's got bacon and in the afternoon, it has sandwiches and some other stuff. \n\nYou get what you pay for, and always leave with a full stomach. \n\nFun fact: This is my first time back in two years, and NONE of the staff have changed. Good sign that they're treated well.
