Very good noodles no doubt, although, nothing better than average. So I disagree with my yelp comrades;there's a bit of star inflation here.. It really a 3 star but I have to take away a star for the  \"we don't give a fuck attitude of the waitstaff\" and, -ready for this- gross out alert !\nIn plain view of everyone  I saw our waitress coughing up a luggie and spitting it in the trash can behind the counter ...not sure we'll be finishing the leftovers she packed for us.
