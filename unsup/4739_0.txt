I've passed this place for years and finally decided to stop in today.  I had no idea what to expect but I was ready for the challenge.  Italian ice is the shit!!! There were so many flavors to choose from. I opted for fuzzy wuzzy which was kinda sweet and tart but pleased the tastebuds.  I feel so ashamed that I had not tried this place.  It's a treat to your tongue.
