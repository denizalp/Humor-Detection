I came here looking for a PS Vita charger. They didn't have the cable, just the a.c. adapter. All the boxes for the a.c. adapters were opened and damaged. In addition to this, the store sold a bunch of $5 knock off perfumes completely undermining the credibility of anything you purchase here. I have yet to buy any item from any Frys location ever.\n\nPros are: lots of parking and an entertaining entrance. Slot machine themed of course
