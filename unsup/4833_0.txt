Very clean place with great customer service. Love their Asian desserts. The cashier Hector was friendly and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had. Kudos! I hope they have an Asian supermarket next in Henderson. We ordered 2 smoothies and get another one free. The kiwi, avocado & Thai tea smoothies were delicious. Love the fact that they have baguettes ready every 30 mins. Hot & Crunchy. The baguettes reminds me of my hometown's supermarket bakery then called Yokoso in Singapore. We will be there again soon. Yay!
