There are a handful of places to hang out and have a proper sit down meal in the Charlotte airport. Uptown gets the job done if you're halfway down the A concourse and not interested in a Wendy's burger.\n\nBut they do have burgers and fries and pizza. And lots and lots of booze.\n\nSo if you're looking for a little dutch courage before you board your aluminum can, Uptown is the spot.
