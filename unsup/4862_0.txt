The CHRC pop-up cafe is fantastic! Great coffee, friendly service and a very interesting atmosphere. The gym itself was a bustle of activity between the sparring taking place in ring and the fitness classes going on behind a closed door. It was a very positive and oddly motivating place to have a coffee and do some laptop work.
