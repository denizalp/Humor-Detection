I'm a book junkie, so it's easy to give any B&N a glowing review.  This one in particular is one of my favorites in the Charlotte area (vs. the locations at Carolina Place Mall and off the corner of Sharon\/Colony).  The reason being is that it's one level, so everything you could possibly need is all within the same walking floor: magazines, books from every genre, and attractive central eatery with plenty of seating.
