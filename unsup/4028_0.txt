Sushi just isn't the same in Montreal.  Since there isn't a Japanese clientele except for the occasional tourist,  it's completely catered to the locals. However they do have some great things on the menu like chicken cutlet, eggplant and tempura on their appetizer list. My favorite meal  is to have a martini and order their dinner salad, chicken cutlet, veggie tempura, miso soup and rice.  It's like eating  a meal at someone's home in Japan, but it's Montreal.
