Look, I eat Vegas Buffets all the time but I normally do the higher quality Aria, Bellagio, Wynn, Cosmo, Caesars and have zero digestive problems.\n\nI had the Buffet of Buffets deal and went to Harrahs for Omelette and Oatmeal breakfast coffee and OJ.\n\nWell minutes later I found myself clenching my buttocks and speed walking down to Venetian not wanting to shit my pants.  \n \nDon't do Buffet of Buffets deal especially if you don't have free comps.
