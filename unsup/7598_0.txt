I ordered a Belgian Waffle, side of hash brown and freshly squeezed orange juice. \n\nThe Belgian Waffle was amazing! It was soft, fluffy and so sweet!  The hash browns were definitely crispy and large quantity. The freshly squeezed orange juice was actually freshly squeezed. It's B-O-M-B! It's about $4.50 for a tall glass. \n\nGet there early! They're full all day everyday!
