My 2 guests fell asleep - so I cant give it 4 stars.  But I actually enjoyed the singing and storyline.  If you born 1970 and later- realize that this is a show that predates you - so chances are you will only know a few songs. \n\nBut if you appreciate good oldies and a great true story - then I recommend.
