This is a great place for those seeking help with addictions. The staff are very caring and helpful. They have the best gym I have ever seen in a recovery center along with some very compassionate staff, a great chef, and some awesome therapist.  \n\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with drugs or alcohol, insist on getting help.  Call them or just come in, either way this place is helpful.  They have excellent AA\/NA groups (free) and offer many other services as well.
