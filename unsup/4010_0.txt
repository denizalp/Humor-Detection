Charging guys $100 to get in last Friday night.  No wonder there was no line.  Who in their right mind would pay $100 on a normal Friday night?  Well it was Beyonce's after party.  Still,  something says the ppl aren't that dumb with this economy to pay that.  Maybe if it was NYE.  Needless to say,  I went over to another club across the street with a line that was pretty deep.\n\nThis is a beautiful club from what I've heard.
