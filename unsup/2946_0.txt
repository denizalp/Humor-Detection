After several visits in the same week, I'm updating my review (downgrading) because of one very specific and annoying thing.  \n\nLittle flies. Fruit flies. I ignored it (them) the first night. I noticed them more the second. The third they were annoying. The fourth, they were irritating.\n\nI didn't go back. Found a restaurant called Molinari's. My money was better spent there.
