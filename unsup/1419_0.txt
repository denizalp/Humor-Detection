Although the service was friendly and fast, I got a lot more than  expected with my order when I woke up with a raging  case of food poisoning within hours of eating. I know the old adage, you get what you pay for but I'm honestly surprised it's possible to even get food poisoning from taco bell since 90% of their food is \"just add water\" fake crap. \n\nEither way, lesson learned. The cheapest of cheap isn't worth the bowel shattering explosions I'm currently enduring.
