This teriyaki chicken bowl is tasty enough, but is in serious need of more chicken; I mean come-on, I need my protein people!!!  The taste is just okay, not the best.  The decor is nice for a fast food Japanese restaurant, but I don't review on atmosphere \/ decor, but on quality of food and pride of ownership \/ customer service.  3 stars is a fair review for the afformentioned determinations.
