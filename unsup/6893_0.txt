To quote Heavy D \"Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?\"  I have fallen in love with this park and Im gonna get as much time there as I can.  Great walking trails, beach is combed daily (if not damn near close to it).  Good view and its fun watching the older gay dudes who meet on Grinder link up.  Soon they will start selling beer and I wont have to keep my flask in my fanny pack!
