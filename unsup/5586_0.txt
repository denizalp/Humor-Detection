One word: Fasion Icon! This place had so many hidden deals it was like the garmet district of LA! I have never found under one roof so many designer clothes at those notorious \"roll back\" prices. They should rename it: WALHOUSE. Its a fashion house mecca and there are even people that MAKE the clothes in the back. 5 Stars!
