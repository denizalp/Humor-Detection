We wanted a booth so we had sat in a dirty one in hopes of a waitress to come clean it and serve us. She tended to all other booths in our section came to ours, I asked her if our table could please be cleaned - she picked up two glasses - turned around with a snotty attitude and didn't bother asking us for our order after we had waited for over half hour. We walked out very disappointed - was looking forward to trying this place out but will not be returning.
