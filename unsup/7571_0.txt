It's eh, not really fresh or tasty but a cheap alternative to the surrounding restaurants. It's not my favourite place but they do have the best prices for drinks or snacks (granola bars, crackers, etc), and dairy products (cheese sticks, etc...)\n\nI don't really think this is a good place to do your groceries all the time, it is very cramped. \n\nIt's an ok grocery store, staff is kinda rude but they don't take forever.
