I've been going to Susan off and on for a few years now and she is is simply one of the best massage therapist I've ever gone too.  I'm definety loving the new location shes at now because its a relaxing and peaceful environment.  One thing that sets her above the rest of the personal massage therapist is thatt she makes accomadations to meet your needs or your schedule.  I've been in on a Sunday before which totally works for me because of my hectic work schedule.  \n\nI left the appointment feeling refreshed and totally relaxed.
