This is what I call OMG food AND service.  I was visiting Phoenix for the PFChangs RnR Marathon and was just walking by this place.  Stopped in for what I thought would be just a \"bar food\" quick lunch.  I had the BLT and the Market salad.  They were orgasmic...yes, I said orgasmic.  The waitress was so incredibly nice, and the chef even came out and talked to us because we were so oh'g and ah'g over his food.  A MUST GO if you are in the area.
