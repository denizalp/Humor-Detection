The most beautiful Starbucks evvvvrrrrr!!!!\n\nLocated kitty-corner from stunning City Hall lies this beautiful work of art.\n\nKeeping with MCM and old Vegas architecture this beauty is covered in rock, brick and wood accents.\n\nI can't believe I get to call this my \"home store\"!\n\nFrom the wood accents, to the bricks, seating and patio...everything is perfection. Check out my pics.\n\nStaff had smiles from ear to ear boasting proud of their new workplace. \n\nExcept the parking lot, it blows there are approximately 14 parking spaces and they were all full when arrived here Day 1 at 2pm.
