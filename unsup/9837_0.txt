It's striking to see how a once exalted hotel has deteriorated over the years... various tack-ons to our stay have increased the daily cost of our hotel room to over $30 per day. Yesterday, as we walked by the Holiday Inn Express we thought about the amenities there versus those available at the Wyndham. While it's key attribute is location, upon our next visit to Cleveland we will consider other options.\n\nProtip: free lobby coffee ends @ 8:30 AM. They're more than happy to sell you a cup of Joe for $2.00 after that. Good thing there's a Starbucks nearby.
