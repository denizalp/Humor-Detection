One of my favorite stores.  Very lovely garden and home decorations where I always find something for gifts.  Beautiful Asian influenced pieces, Italian dinnerware, and just that extra little something for that perfect spot in the garden.  Kind of one of those places I have to look through and enjoy, even if I don't buy... though I usually do walk out with a little something.
