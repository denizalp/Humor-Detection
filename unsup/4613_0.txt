Food is average - if that. I place orders via EAT24, and delivery time is NEVER what is quoted. Today it's been one hour and 45 minutes and STILL no food. Despite EAT24 telling me it's on the way. Called the restaurant and can't get an answer. I've placed a few orders with this place and today's is going to be the LAST. Their food is definitely NOT worth a 2 freaking hour wait.
