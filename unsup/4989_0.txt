Service is extremely slow, and customer service is poor.... Food is just .... Meh.... Place is very run down and in need of some serious updating....\nIf you enjoy slow crappy service and sub standard food this place is for you.... If not, scottsdale has many many other options that are by far more appetizing than Chompies.
