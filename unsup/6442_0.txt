The Velo kept popping up on my Yelp list, so decided to stop in yesterday and check out this place in our neighborhood.  We were warmly welcomed and immediately went to the cafe.  I ordered an herbal hibiscus rose prickly pear iced tea with agave...it was seriously the best iced tea I have ever tasted - amazing!  I will definitely be back and hope they continue to serve this tea...I'm hooked!  We hung out on the sofa and watched some sports while enjoying our tasty beverages.
