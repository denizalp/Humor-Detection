Amazing cronuts! We tried the cinnamon and sugar ones, which were all they had on a Sunday. Very flaky and light layers like an croissant and sugary flavor. The glaze was delicious hut but I liked the cinnamon the best. They also had sandwiches with the cronut as the bun. We didn't try those but it sounds yummy. The food truck was at Cabarrus brewery when we visited. I would like to try the desserts sometime!
