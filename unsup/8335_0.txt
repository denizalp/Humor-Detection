WICKED SPOON IS MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!\n\n$50 for lunch, but you will eat your heart out!\n\nEverything is amazing. The bread display, the mini salads (love the BLT), the shrimp cocktail, the Korean bbq, the Asian food, the desserts. I LOVE THEIR DESSERTS. I literally just eat plates and plates of the dessert and have some normal food in between to refresh my palate from all the sweetness...then I go back for more.\n\nTo be fair, I love all the Vegas buffets and high quality buffets in general. Because good food rocks, but good food in unlimited quantities slays me.
