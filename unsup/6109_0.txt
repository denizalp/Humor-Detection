My new guilty pleasure. We've been making weekly visits and it's addicting...\n\nBecause it's a chain - there's two things that tell all stores apart...flavor variety and cleanliness.\n\nThis location gets 5 stars in both categories. The toppings are always filled high and look fresh as opposed to other places where you can tell they've been sitting out awhile and the counters are sticky. Here it's always clean and the staff is always friendly.\n\nAnd even though my yogurt and toppings of choice look like something a 4 year old chose, I just keep coming back for more.
