Purchased Catnapper furniture set. Quick and easy as long as you use your common sense and read before you sign. There like any other furniture store if you get financed thru them. So far all furniture stores I have been too only have bad reviews, vulture sale reps and half way decent prices. Sale rep David was helpful not to pushy, received our furniture on time. Loveseat was torn, they took it back brought another the next day. So far so good.
