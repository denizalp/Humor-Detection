I have been here 4 or 5 times and each time for less than 3 minutes. I went here because I read that there were hot guys here from ASU and what not. Not true at all. Men are repulsive in every way, really unattractive. It also smells really nasty in there. The last time I went there it smelled like they had not cleaned the place up in days. The staff is fine though so I gave it 2 stars. Other than that it's a place to skip if you are not a troll.
