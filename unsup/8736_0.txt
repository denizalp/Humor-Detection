Absolutely amazing! I love this place! The staff is very friendly, prices are definitely decent.   Quality food\/meats (our favorite is the Prime Kalbi), very tasty curry, perfectly steamed rice, and the miso soup! Omg! Yum, such a wonderful delicate flavor!!! I can't wait until I can go back to try the ramen! Yay! This restaurant is definitely a must try, you will not be disappointed!
