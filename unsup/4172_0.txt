I lived in Tremont for years but had never had brunch here until last weekend when my cousin was in town. They got there early and got a table and brunch was amazing! My husband and I both had the Shipwreck and it was life changing! We could have easily shared one but my god, was it tasty! We will definitely be going back and taking friends. Get a seat early and enjoy!
