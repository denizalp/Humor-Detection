When I saw Pho Bac, I was expecting some Bac flavor.  The southern vs northern style of Pho is distinctly different.  In the USA, we generally only have the southern style, so whenever, we get a chance to eat the northern style we get excited.  When the bowl came out the flavor was just what we get in the USA.  Overall, it wasn't bad but nothing spectacular.  Service was fine and it is CASH only.
