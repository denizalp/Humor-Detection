Great burger. Solid fries. What makes this place unique is the toppings. Not many offer sprouts in the first place, nor do many places not charge extra for things like guac and bruschetta, let alone have it as an option. I also prefer that they use grated cheese and not a slice. Makes the cheese melt in a much cooler way. As for the whole licks wannabe stuff, that's just ridiculous. Magoos has been around for a long time. It has a relatively oldschool diner template, not sure why Licks is the poster boy for this.
