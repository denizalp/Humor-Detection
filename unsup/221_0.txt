Should've read these other reviews: DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PAYLESS IN PHOENIX UNLESS YOU ARE A TOTAL IDOT - YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Not just lousy, but non-existent customer service; pushy, deceptive used-car-salesman approach while signing their ppwk so we can rent our internet-reserved car; crummy vehicle long past it's usable rental period by any other car rental company standard - overall, a poor value compounded by lousy service and an overall p-poor experience - never using this Payless again.
