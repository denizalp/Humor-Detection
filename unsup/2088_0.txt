Red 8 is good in a pinch.  Especially at lunch time when Wing Llei does not want to open for you.  \n\nIn particular the ox tail soup is surprisingly good.  The string beans are perfectly cooked albeit a little over seasoned.  The chow fun is mediocre but not bad.  The dim sum items are hits and misses with some strangely peculiar flavors.  \n\nAll in all, if you're extremely lazy and don't want to leave the Wynn\/Encore buildling like me, this place ain't too shabby.
