I feel so stupid. Yeah I know everybody always likes Chipotle..but I just didn't get it. Maybe I was sick the one time I ate there  or I was on a diet or something . Cuz now I freaking love it! I was starving after moving a ton of stuff from my classroom and realized it was right near my new work.  Sent grandma and daughter to get some food and bring me back a burrito. Holy Frijoles ! That burrito was good.  I will so be back.
