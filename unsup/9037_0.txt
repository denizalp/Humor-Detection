My coworkers went here for lunch. Last time they went they said the food was great. This time, we all agreed it was disappointing. I had the bbq bowl and the Mac n cheese was awfully bland. It was more like Mac and a touch of butter. The lemonade was super watery as well. I'm sure it can be better than this, but if I'm paying $10+ for my meal, it shouldn't be a hit or miss experience.
