So this place needs a good deep clean. All they do is have kids running this place. My son asked one of him to climb the walk wall and he told my son he was busy and he will go over there later. Then this kids went to the front desk to start text messaging on his phone. He is lucky I didn't pick him up and throw him off the rock wall for talking to my kid like that.\nThey get a one star because one of the girls put the tv on sports center for me.
