I want to love this place... But unfortunately the terrrrrrible (really, really bad) customer service means I never want to go in here. \nEver.\nStop treating your customers like crap- we come to buy and walk away empty handed because giving money to an establishment that is so careless about human decency just encourages the awful service.
