By far the slowest Starbucks I've been to in the valley. Really disappointed since I work down the street. I go out of my way to go to the drive-thru on Hardy because even with travel time I'm usually done quicker and without a wrong order. I just spent 14 minutes at the window for two unsweetened teas. 14 minutes before anyone even opened the window to have me pay... It's obvious the employees were more worried about leaving on time than helping me. Will make sure to recommend against coming here.
