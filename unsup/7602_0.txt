I'm British so I'm pretty fussy about my Indian food. This was ... not great. Some of it was ok. The daal, for example, was quite nice and the rice pudding was delicious. However everything else tasted like a microwave meal. It all kind of tasted the same ... the Korma, the tikka masala and the aloo gobi- not very fresh and a bit like it came from a jar. The roti was strange, more like a tortilla. \nI wouldn't eat here again, unless I was just having dessert, in which case I would eat ALL the rice pudding.
