Cherry Vanilla bagels are back!!! :) So good. We go there for bagels, always good, never fails. The bummer is the cream cheese isnt the best but whatever, it's a bakery not a dairy :)\n\nThe service is always friendly, could use a more intelligent staff, but I think I may be asking for too much in that dept. WIll always come for bakery items....the rest of the menu has no special desire in my soul.
