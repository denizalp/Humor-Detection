It is a Walmart Super Store.... \n\nIt can be fun to people watch here, there is every walk of life. Homeless, Millionaires, Black, White, Hispanic, Cowboys, Gangs, unsupervised kids, armless people, midgets, huge fat guys, etc etc...\n\nI go when I need something and usualy go through the garden area. The checkers there are nice usually.
