What an amazing \"mom and pop\" game shop. The lady was so adorably nice and they have most anything, system wise, in stock. I was not able to take the time to look around, but there's a lot to see in the store. So many items. \n\nMy husband and brother in law love their new Super Nintendo. \n\nWe will be back!
