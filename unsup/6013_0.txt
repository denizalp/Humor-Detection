I've seen everyone perform here from Black Francis and Reid Paley to local friends and then some.\nCozy singer songwriter style venue with a really good sound system.\nIntimate way to watch performers and interact with them.\nNice bar area with pricing you'd expect and they serve food as well.\nSmall tables for seating and most shows are standing room only. If you want a seat for a popular show you definitely need to get there early.
