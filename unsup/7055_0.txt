My God... Where do I begin to tell the story of how great a macaron can be. I don't need to tell a story, please visit french corner for your macaron fix. You will be hooked. I promise. The bread: olive bread - best ever. Took a baguette to work, people went crazy over it. Other pastries - simply amazing, especially the spinach and feta tart and the chock raspberry croissant and the almond croissant. Soup of the day is made from scratch and absolutely heartwarming and comforting. Love this place.
