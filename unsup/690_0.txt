Won't go here again, unfortunately. Took what seemed forever to get my latte and another customer had to holler to ask for the music volume to be turned down.  Owner was clearly more concerned with \"ambience\" than service and not on top of her good-looking staff, who were consumed with the task of polishing glasses. Shame, I was looking forward to supporting a small local business.
