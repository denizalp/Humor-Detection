I stayed at this hotel for a conference. I ate lunch and dinner. My sandwich for lunch took almost 40 minutes to get. I passed the time listening to one of the bartenders tell the other all about an annoying customer. The Chicken was tough too. The dinner took even longer even though the place was half empty. It would take less time to walk somewhere else and the food would be better. Hotel was great, but this place is terrible.
