Recently found out that my eyes are a medical issue that is completely unrelated to having my liner tattooed. It turns out it's a thyroid issue. I apologize and I hope this comment didn't detour anyone from having this procedure done. The specialist that treated my eyes actually said the liner looked great and I agree.
