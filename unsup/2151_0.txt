Solid addition to dt Las Vegas. A must see if visiting Freemont st. Whisky list is impressive. Burgers were really good with fig goat cheese bacon one the most memorable . Came back for brunch and the $5 bloody on weekend is an insane deal. I heard  there is Hawaiian off the menu burger. Need to check that out next time. \n\n\n                                                                             EDC ;)
