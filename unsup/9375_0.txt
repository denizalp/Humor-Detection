Fascinating tour. Beautifully patinated signs. The guide explains how expensive it is to repair the signs and how the museum is self funding so it's not all that surprising that more of them don't work. The faded grandeur of the broken signs is just as attractive as the lit signs anyway. My phone is groaning under the weight of the photos I took. A great way to pass an hour.
