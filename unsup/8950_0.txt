What great group working at this location!!!! After any oil change service at Jiffy Lube, I like coming here to see what self service options I after declining the over-prices cost of Jiffy Lube.  The guys here has personally shown me how to change out my headlight lamps, air filters and explained how to other miscellaneous maintenances of my  trucks.   They are honest and extremely helpful!  I highly recommend this store to everyone, especially to those who don't know much about vehicles!
