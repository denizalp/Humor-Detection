It's my neighbourhood dry cleaner and the Korean couple running it are not only friendly but also knowledgeable. They will check that garments are indeed meant for dry cleaning and if there is a garment that would be too risky to dry clean, they inform you and let you know they don't recommend it (& give you alternatives).
