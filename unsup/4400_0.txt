Whoever thinks this place serves good Thai food doesn't know what authentic\/good Thai food is.\n\nPutting tons of sugar in the food doesn't make it Thai food. The seafood wasn't very fresh last night but shall I forgive them considering the weather was very hot?\n\nThis place serves Orange chicken. Any place that serves orange chicken cannot be good because this is not an Asian dish and is a pure invention of Americans\n\nAnyways, was recommended by a bunch of local coworkers.  Now at least I know who not to ask r\/ food choices next time in town
