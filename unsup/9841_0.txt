A good deal for what it's worth. An older building. They have free wifi, tv and cable in each room, free breakfast, and a pool. Stayed here just one night and it was all that was needed! Not the best neighborhood to walk around but there are stores, restaurants (quick food) and many hotels nearby. Close to freeway.
