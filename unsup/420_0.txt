my last review was in 2012, and towards end of 2014 my review still stands. I had a craving for Pho last week and I went to Pho Xuan in 36th  st. NE, the next day I have to go to noodle world to satisfy the craving...coz the other place didnt cut it. Even my doggie didnt like the spring rolls I brought home from Pho Xuan. I hope they NEVER close! family owned, very friendly. yah, the paint is pink....not a biggie, the food is awesome! serving is more than enough!
