Really different and delicious sandwiches. The quality of the meat is amazing. The unique combination of flavors is off the charts good. I tasted the Vermonter and the Pastrami. The bread on the Vermonter was very disappointing but love the stuff between the bread. It could have been perfect. How do you ruin perfection with bread???? The Pastrami was terrific tho. The pasta salad was awful. Also had the cobb salad. It was terrific.
