This is a new massive event space. Needless to day, I did not see the entire venue, but what I saw was very good. The rooms are large and configurable. The staff were gracious. Hopefully I will go to another event here soon. When I do I will expand this review. So in short, if you get invited to an event at Enclave, go! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
