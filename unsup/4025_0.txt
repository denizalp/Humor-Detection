My mom doesn't use a computer and she called me and asked to make a review for Priority Plumbing.  One thing I know about my mom is that she is a hard person to please and nobody pulls the wool over her eyes.  So if she tells me that Priority Plumbing took care of her, then I know they did.  If your mom asks you who call for a plumber in Toronto tell her Priority.  They made my mom happy, which I have been trying to do for years.
