Delicious! I'm obsessed with their spicy chicken ramen and their breaded shrimp. I usually go at night, which is always packed (that's how you know it's really good), but it's 100% worth the wait. I've been to other ramen bars and it's just not the same. They attract good people, which give the restaurant a good vibe.
