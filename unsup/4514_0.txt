Absolutely phenomenal when it comes to treating skin. I've had several treatments done by her for various skin issues. She had great suggestions and treatment plans to get my skin back on track. I love the microdermabrasion and her oxygen facial treatments. Her knowledge on skin types and issues is great as she was able to asses and give me feedback on different products I should use and products I need to avoid.
