I went here last night and the massage was fantastic. I got a one hour massage, but it was extended a bit because my massage guy kept leaving to address incoming customers at the front counter. Otherwise, I would've given a 5 star rating. I will go again. Hopefully, next time they will have someone manning the front counter so this guy can complete his massages uninterrupted.
