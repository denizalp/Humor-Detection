The worst meal i've had in such such such a long time!\nNo taste what so ever! I literally had it about 15 mins ago, and I currently have some weird stomach aches!\nTwo of us bought two of their super bowls.it's a tasteless pile of things that don't go together..\nThe shouthwest bowl and the Zen bowl!\nUghhh! Who mixes cilantro with Mango with quniua with rice with cherry tomatoes! OMG!\nI tried one of their protein sub, that is a Quinua balls! The nastiest thing on planet earth!\nThose two bowls cost me $23!\nHorrible horrible experience! Stay away!
