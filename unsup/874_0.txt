Decent food court option: it's pricey like airport food, though. $8+ for a large sandwich, $4 to add a small drink\/fry, $6 for a regular drink\/fry add-on. It gets pricey fast.\n\nBut on the bright side, the cheesesteaks are actually pretty tasty. Your choice of cheese, several combinations of mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc. You can also customize fries and add cheese, gravy, chili, and other toppings. Not a place to hit on a diet.
