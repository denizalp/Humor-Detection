My go to spot for wonton noodles. For $5, you can get a big bowl of wonton noodles or wonton rice noodles. The wontons are huge and the broth is amazing. I would recommend adding some of their signature hot sauce into the broth.\n\nFor newcomers, this restaurant is self-serve meaning you grab your own tea and water st the back. Remember to bring cash!
