Hands down my favourite pho place - I've literally lost count of how many times I've been here over the past few months. \n\nThe staff are always friendly and I am usually seated very quickly if the place is not busy. Every bowl of pho I've gotten is filled with plenty of meat - they don't skimp out unlike other places! Beef is alwsys tender and soup base is very flavourful! \n\nBonus, they have wifi here too!
