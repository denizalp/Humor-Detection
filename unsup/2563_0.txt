AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!\n\nThis has to be the worst hotel I've ever encountered. Between losing my reservation, having only 1 elevator that works (it comes every 30 minutes and most of the time is full), and a very RUDE security guard who wouldn't let me charge my cell phone at a wall outlet in the lobby and who physically accosted me, I will NEVER stay here again, nor would I recommend this place to anyone. The one plus is free wifi in the lobby that let me write this review.
