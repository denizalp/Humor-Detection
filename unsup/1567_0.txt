Their great don't cha know! Not only are they unknowledgeable of what to do in any given situation, but they also always do the wrong thing. Only one word comes to mind... DOUCHE... I guess thats why they are in Phoenix...\n\nNow if you yourself are a police officer, this isn't necessarily against you unless you are the douche who took my license plate off of my vehicle without proper and valid reason. I am going to find out who you are and get you fired you sorry excuse for an officer.
