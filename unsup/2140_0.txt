Wow I can't believe how perfect Shaina got my eyebrows to look. After a threading disaster, I had a bald patch that would not grow back. I didn't know if there was ever going be a chance to get my brows to look the same again. But somehow Shaina did it!! And I'm so happy with the shape!!!\n\nMayley at the front is awesome too... What a great team they have there!\n\nNever getting threaded again. Pink Cherry rocks!
