I get so excited when I come across a menu where I would be thrilled to order just about anything offered. I went with the hemp burger, since it was recommended by other Yelpers, and it didn't disappoint. I also like how the portions were reasonable; I finished everything and felt nicely satisfied instead of overstuffed. One interesting note is that they charge for their in-house hot sauce. It was nice and strong, but I felt weird paying for a tiny little saucer of hot sauce.
