while it may have irked me if it wasn't so darn cute, something about the size of this place (maybe 5 stools at the bar & merely 3 beers on draft) charmed the pants off me. magners in a can & a bartender who indulged with me in jameson shots. fellow patrons who gave my wife a hash brownie for her birthday. local music acts. totally rad.
