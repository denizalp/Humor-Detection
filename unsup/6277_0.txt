Yogurtolgy was my very first froyo place.  It was quite an experience.  I filled my froyo cup up with three favors (mint, oatmeal, and strawberry).  Next stop was the toppings, added some Reese's pieces and some coconut. Then I went to the cashier to pay my froyo. So, I did not realize that they charge you by ounce at the time.  It was $10.00 for my cup of froyo.  \n\nIf you ever go to a frozen yogurt place, just remember that they charge by ounce. :)
