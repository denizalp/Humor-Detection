My sister and I decided to try this place based on the reviews on Yelp.  The sushi was delicious,  especially the Island Paradise.   It was nothing we have tried before,  but in a very good way.  Very tasty, we would definitely order it again.   My sister ordered the calamari. It was crunchy and delicious and cooked properly.  I ordered the lunch portion of pork fried rice.   This was the only thing that was just mediocre.   Not great flavor,  just kind of bland.   I wouldn't get this again.   Overall,  we will most likely return.
