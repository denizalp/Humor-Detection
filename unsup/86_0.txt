I thought I would never find a Mexican restaurant in Madison I liked.  Then came Fiesta Cancun.  Cheap prices, no orange cheese anywhere, good portions, and delicious food.  I loved the spinach quesadilla I had, and the margaritas are only $3.75 at regular price.  Really good service too.  I love it!  \n\n-NOT like Cancun in Madison either.  Completely unrelated and a million times better.-
