Don't waste your time. The charac board, already $30, comes with 4 pieces of PANCAKE. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME, PANCAKE. When I asked for sub of bread, the very rude, very hipster bar tender told me that would be another $4. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME, ANOTHER $4!\n\nDont waste your time or money on this pretentious bull shit place, there's great food next door.
