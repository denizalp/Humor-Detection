Reading these reviews is hilarious. Don't people realize that salt = flavor?\n\nAnyway, I go there a decent amount, but mainly for sustenance. Those who think this is somehow better than Chipotle are insane. At best, they're roughly the same. The meats are better at Chipotle, but OCB take better care in preparing your burrito and gives you free guac. Oh, and neither is authentic. But that's not really the point.\n\nI do like that they have horchata (but it's way too sweet) and Mexican coke, though.
