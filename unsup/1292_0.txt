We've never done anything like this before and thought we'd give it a try....\nThe food was REALLY delicious but challenging to eat - I mean it is like eating with your eyes closed! Our server KEN did an amazing job telling us exactly WHAT and WHERE everything was (\"You have three ball shaped items on the left of the plate.\"). Ken also paired wines for our seven courses - PERFECTLY! I would do this again with a Groupon cause it was pretty pricey!!
