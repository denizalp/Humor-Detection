Just a head up. I barely leave a review as you guys my profile. However, I use yelp every time for food and places to go. I found this XS night club when I was traveling in Vegas; it has 2000+reviews and 4 stars; I thought it would be an awesome club to go; it turned out that this place SUCKS!!!! Customers is bad, alcohol is just find. The most important thing was that it kept us in line for 2hr+. It WASN't worth the WAIT!!!! Don't go there!!
