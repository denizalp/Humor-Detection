Came here for lunch and dinner, and was impressed with the food quality for both times. I'm not usually the type to go to Japanese restaurants purely for the sushi rolls but the taste and quality here was superb!\n\nOn a cold winter day, the seafood bowl on rice is excellent for those who want a filling and warm meal. Their sashimi selection is also fresh and reasonably priced.\n\nFor sweet tooths, I recommend the matcha creme brulee, it is fantastic, you gotta try it for yourself to see!
