This store is one of my love to hate kind of stores to shop at, it is great when everything is on sale and you get amazing deals, and terrible for when it is at regular price, the clothes can be hit or miss interns of there durability.  Always buy one size bigger, everything shrinks in the wash it seems. Great place to pick up unique pieces.
