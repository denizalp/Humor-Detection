My friends got shooed away from the Ellis Island bar, so, as an act of solidarity, I decided to eat here, and oh man, I would have their carne asada burrito and horchata over $5 wings and fries any day of the week.\n\nThe portion was HUGE for $7, and you're free to peruse the casino with burrito in hand. If that's not a burrito to rule all burritos, then I don't know what is.
