This is our second time eating here and it was a good as I remember. The chips and salsas they provide upon seating are seriously some of the best I've had! We both ordered the taco trio on their lunch menu. One pork, one steak, and one shrimp. They were all good, but my favorite was the steak. The reason we came back was for the Tres Leches! It is absolutely delicious and I wish I could have it all the time. The service is great and the view of the Mandalay Bay pool is gorgeous.
