Hit up this spot for lunch today. There was a bit of a lineup but was pretty much in and out of there in 12 minutes(yes i timed it). \n\nI got a custom burger with spicy aoli, *balsamic fried onions*, goat cheese and tomato. The bun was flaky but not dry, large beef pattie wasn't overcooked and the toppings coming together just made it DIVINE. \n\nDefinitely my new favourite burger spot in the city.\n\n$9 without a drink or fries. \n\nAnd let me say this again: BALSAMIC FRIED ONIONS!
