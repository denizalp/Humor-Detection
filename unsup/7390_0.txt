I love the staff and service here. Extremely helpful. Purchased something and was just outside of their delivery zone, but they did it anyway. But this is many years ago, so I cannot guarantee the same thing happening. A good attitude with a sprinkle of persuasion would probably do it though \n\nFantastic variety of...everything here. \n\nAs much as I like the staff, the prices are definitely way above market price. You can find almost everything here cheaper at another store.
