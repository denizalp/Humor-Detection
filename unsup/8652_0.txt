Advertising is sooo misleading sometimes...thought i'd bring my designer duds in for quick cash...NOPE...they rejected all my stuff...But they had a whole smelly store of really worn cloths...my stuff was current, clean, worn once...I guess it was too good for this DUMP...Workers there really had NO fashion sense, they were dressed to wash cars...but the worst insult was the Nasty worn out shoes displayed at nose level, above the cloths....Prices at Gabes on NEW STUFF are less then these well worn stinkey cloths!
