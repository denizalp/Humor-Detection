I've had so many issues with this post office.  They've lost a few of my packages for example.  Most recently, they were just super rude.  I got to the post office minutes before they closed (as verified on my phone), but they had closed up already and refused to service me.  Supposedly, their \"official time\" is based on an analog clock on the wall, which I guess was running a little fast. (I doubt it works the other way though, ie. they opening early).
