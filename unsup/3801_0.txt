This Asian grocery store opened one month ago. What I like about this grocery store is that although bit on the smaller side, it's well organized and finding things were straight forward. The cashier was very friendly and tried to get to know you. I'm not sure if she was the owner, but she talked to everyone as she was ringing them up. Also, they have hard to find produce. Today, I was happy to find mangosteen; always wanted to try it and today was it. If I'm in the area again, I would stop in again.
