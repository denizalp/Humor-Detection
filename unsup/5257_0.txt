Some old guy thinks he knows everything. I went there to get my dependency form notarize. An old,black guy claiming to be retired marine have no respect, arrogant, and racist. I tried to explain him what the form for, but he wont listen and thinks he knows everything. He knows nothing and i will never go to this place again. Worst and disrespectful customer service. This base in my personal experience.
