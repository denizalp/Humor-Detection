To me Fry's is an absolute playground and always a fun experience. Hopefully the Summerlin Boca Park location will open relatively soon. I like the fact that they have a huge hands on selection of Movies on DVD and even Vinyl for Professional DJs like myself. The Center Cafe is great. If you need an electronic adapter, they usually have it and so much more available to pick up immediately. One couldn't ask for more!!
