Got my locked bikes stolen from bike rack in front of store today, in broad daylight. Theft was caught on surveillance tape, but my bikes are still gone... Not sure where store security was or why they didn't walk outside to stop the theft. Guess I spent too much time shopping and not enough running my own security tactics.
