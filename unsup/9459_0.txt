This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I got The Hog & Chick and it was amazing. Scrambled eggs, amazing thick cut bacon seasoned to perfection, delicious big sourdough toast, and hashbrowns I could eat for the rest of my life. Everything's made in house or sourced locally and it tastes like it--super fresh and satisfying. Even the iced coffee is ground daily and was lovely. Couldn't have asked for a better meal. Also the decor and entire old school hipster branding fits perfectly--very appealing.
