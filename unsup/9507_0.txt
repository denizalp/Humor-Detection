Should have tried their baked goods.  They are a bakery, but I do not believe they make the items at this location.  By the way, you will find them underground close to the Eaton Centre in Montreal.\n\nShame on me for buying their Mango smoothie with Boba.  It was expensive, and it tasted below average.  Way to powdery and artificial.  My bad for ordering this.\n\nOn the plus side, their place was clean.  Stick to trying their bakery items.  Some did appear tasty.  Just do not order the Mango smoothie with Boba!!!
