We stopped here after reading a Yelp review. At 8:00 on a Sunday night the restaurant was humming with customers - reassuringly. Takeout was popular but our tableservice was quick and polite. Highly recommended are the pakora appetizers. We had mango chicken and a spicy prawn dish. Fabulous! The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Wine and beer are available on the menu. A very good dining experience.
