We went here because they have a gluten-free menu.  While the menu is gluten-free, it's not particularly healthy and is full of dairy and fried foods.  There were a few healthier options and I picked the salmon. It was alright. My biggest complaint is that the salad that comes with the entree came covered in croutons.  The waiter knew I ordered from the gluten-free menu but wasn't paying much attention to the details.  Oh well.  I didn't drink the beer but my friend that did said it was good.
