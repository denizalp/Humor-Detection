If I could give no stars I would.this place is a pathetic excuse. They do not acknowledge your presence one bit. Pretty sad since their items I would have wanted to rent since I am a customer frequent online. Although since I wasnt even noticed nor my husband they lost a customer. If managment does read this please do your self a favor and RE-train your staff for both females wish I got or saw their name does not know what customer service is.
