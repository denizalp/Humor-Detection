Stopped by Art Square Cafe for a little late night dessert with the hubby and little man :)\n\nWe all shared a Crepes Suzette and loved it!  It was recommended to us by a European foodie friend.  And according to her, its authentically delicious!  Its hard for me to describe ... hmmm ...just try it!  \n\nAt the time, there was some sort of gallery party going on.  Its a pretty cool spot to check out some cool art.\n\nWhat an awesome little romantic cafe!
