I don't know why i haven't written this post awhile ago..but this isn't my favorite Jerk chicken plate only because I do not like sweet sauces..I know a ton of people who love sweet jerk chicken and to me that's not how it's supposed to taste. It's meant to be spicy and flavorful.The cabbage sweet,jerk sauce sweet and I unknowingly mixed my cabbage and rice before trying it so my rice was then sweet. If your looking for spicy jerk chicken this isn't the place.but portion wise is a good amount for your buck.
