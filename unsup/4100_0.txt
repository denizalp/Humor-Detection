I'm torn.\n\nBecause the bathroom was like something out of a horror movie. I even washed my hands twice and used toilet paper to open the door because I was so grossed out by what I saw.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier gave me a lower price on an item I'd seen online, and then an additional 20% off after that.\n\nSo...3.5?
