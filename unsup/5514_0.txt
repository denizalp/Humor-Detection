This is my go-to hardware store. I always receive the friendliest service and it's easy to get to and navigate through the aisles. The prices are comparable to other hardware stores and you can purchase items online and pick up in the store. If they don't have an item, they'll order it so you can pick it up. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable. There is a HUGE difference between shopping here and somewhere like Menards\/Lowes. \n\nThey provide a 15% discount if you show your iCard!
