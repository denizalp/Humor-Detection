I really wanted to like tako it has a slick cool interior with cool street art, chain link fences and a good dj. However the food was just average. The chorizo tacos had a good rub but thats where the flavor ended. The Bisteak was well seasoned and tender and the meal that saved my dinner from being mediocre. My girlfriend really enjoyed the poke but it wasn't for me. I'ld only come back for the $2 late night taco's.
