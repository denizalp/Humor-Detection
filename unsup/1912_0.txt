This is one of the many ramen places we have in AZ and I think it's pretty decent. You have 2 noodles to choose from which is perfect because it's straight and curly noodles. I prefer curly 100% of the time because of its slight chewy al dente texture. The broth is good, and the huge thick cut chasu pork atop is good, it includes a thick layer of fat and skin too if you're into that. I recommend getting a chicken karaage to share.
