Walked quite a distance fueled by the good words and strong endorsements. After a mile through a sordid part of town, sprinkled with Vegas' finest,  I was met with long faces at the ticket counter and subtly, yet ingloriously chastised for not making a reservation. I complained vehemently to the Uber driver about said treatment and made many family members listen to my lamentations.
