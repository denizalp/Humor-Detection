$17 for two sandwiches that were on par with what my grandma made me as a kid?  Those were free and they came with a kiss.  The concept has potential but there was a huge gap between the price tag and the resulting small sandwich.  Maybe I should have had the fortitude to wait in the line for the Lobster Lady.
