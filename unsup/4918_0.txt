I had a coupon for 25% off, so I decided to go for the Meatball sub.\nThe meat balls are so tender and covered in a delicious sauce, and the bread is very firm, and the perfect size to fit right in your hand.\n\nI have also tried the Chef's coq au vin, which is some of the best I have ever had.\n\nMy only issue with this place was the drink selection. There was only Kirkland Signature water. I would have preferred something a bit more up market, like a Vos.
