Had their tacos and a margarita. Was dissapointed with the marg, the tacos were decent. Prices seemed a bit steep for the tacos, they were small but the price was big. All in all, I wouldn't specifically avoid this place, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to come here. There are better tacos down the street at Gallo Blanco.
