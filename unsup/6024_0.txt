Stumbled upon this great little gem on my way to Hooligan's over the weekend and am I glad I did. Like Todd said, the last thing we needed in town was another cartoonish Irish-themed hellhole. So, when we finally reached the top of the steps, not knowing what the hell we were gonna find, we were very pleasantly surprise to find this little piece of Ireland dead smack in soulless Charlotte downtown area.\n\nNice beer selection but I didn't try the food. Next time for sure. The atmosphere was great and the service incredible.\n\nI will definitely be coming back regularly.
