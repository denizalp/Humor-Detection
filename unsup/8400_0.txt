I don't care if it's a chain, Subway makes decent Sandwiches.  They're also all over the place, so it's normally in a convenient location for me.  I don't go to this location very often, but when I do, they serve up some good Sandwiches.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/subway-scottsdale-12?select=9J9Nbxl0A47SQSbdB8FnEw#9J9Nbxl0A47SQSbdB8FnEw\n\nI always get a 12\" BMT w\/Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Mustard, Mayo, Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Oil....toasted.  It fills me up for lunch and they make it right at this location.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
