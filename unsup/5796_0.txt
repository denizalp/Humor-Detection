Amazing service.  I called with an emergency and Jorge Flores was at my door 20min later with a quick simple fix.  He optimized the drainage, cleaned out the lines and gave the whole unit a check up.  The cost was so affordable and the entire experience was fantastic.  As AC is so crucial in this lovely desert, we will have Flores AC back out every spring for a check up.  Thank you!!!
