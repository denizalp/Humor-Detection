Can lifetime please explain why the \"no phone in locker room\" policy has been changed recently to allow for phone use. The locker room is a place where privacy should be a priority.   Why would lifetime compromise the privacy and safety of their members whether there they are men, women or children? This is an irresponsible decision that needs to be reverted. Or will you wait for compromising photographs to appear on social media. Act now please!
