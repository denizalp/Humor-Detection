Iron Chef serves great sushi and cooked Japanese and Chinese dishes, the ambiance is pleasant, and the servers are extremely efficient and professional.\n\nI love the Golden Dragon Roll, which I get almost every time.  I also like the chicken yaki udon, and my boyfriend likes the kung pao chicken.\n\nYUMMY!
