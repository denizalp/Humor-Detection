This is hands down one of my favorite bakeries ever. Cream & Flutter has the best cupcakes and cakes! My personal favorite is red velvet but I will go for S'mores when it's in season. Honestly, you can't go wrong. It's absolutely amazing.\n\nThere is a lot of seating, both indoor and a patio, that makes C & F a great place to work remote and off campus.\n\nI highly recommend C & F for any celebrations that warrant baked goods, and I mean why not go \"just because\" as well!?
