3\/2016\n\nStopped here the other night, was on a mission to see what was marked down from Christmas!\n\nThere was still items left surprisingly and it was New Years Eve, I have been to this Walgreen's many times before. \n\nI did find some good stuff to buy!  \n\nThe store was clean and the Christmas area was still pretty neat even though it was  getting picked over and a lot of empty areas on the shelves.\n\nThe employees were friendly when asked for help. Great location to stop by!
