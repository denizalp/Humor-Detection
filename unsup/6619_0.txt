If the recruiting department is representative of the university - no way.  The recruiter outright mislead me and failed to disclose vital certification information regarding the AZ Dept of Education.  \n\nGCU better start understanding that a recruiter sets the stage and is often the first person a potential undergrad\/grad student speaks with.  If that interaction is negative, it reflects poorly on the entire university.\n\nNo way I would consider this school.
