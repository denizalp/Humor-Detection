I have been to this location twice now and had a great experience both times.\n\nBoth times I have ordered the Carne Asada burrito with sour cream, cheese and avocado.  The Carne Asada is moist, tasty and I have yet to get a fatty piece.  Ina edition to the burrito I get a side of beens and rice. The beans are without a doubt the best that I have tasted without it being someone's family recipe.\n\nLunch can get very busy but they turn and burn on the orders and it comes out fast.
