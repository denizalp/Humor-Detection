This TJ Maxx is one of my favorite to come to when, I'm in Gastonia, NC. It's a very clean store. They have a great selection of women's clothes to choose from. The location is easy to find. The cashiers seem really friendly every time I'm in there. You want be disappointed that you gave the store a try:)
