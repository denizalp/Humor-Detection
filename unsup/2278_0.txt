It's called a 44 Magnum. Get it. It's a mixture of Octane 190 and the Cat-5 Hurricane. Add double shots. It's like $14.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's hot or cold outside, get one of these puppies in the afternoon and you're good to go for the day. You can't do sugary, sweet and alcohol too often, you just can't! So just try it one or twice in life.\n\nOf all the big, slushy, get-you-sloshed drinks in Vegas, this one was by fa the best. I recommend Fat Tuesday for sure!
