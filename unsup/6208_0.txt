I love Arrowhead Dermatology and Chuck Rimer. He is kind, courteous and quick. I have had two types of skin cancer removed and he helps make me feel comfortable even when I feel overwhlemed. I apreciate how discrete he is during my skin exams, especially since I need one every six months. I have recommended this office to several people with good result. It would take a lot to get me to change dermatologists. Thanks Dr. Rimer
