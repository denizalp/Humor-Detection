I have been coming here for about a year now and was fortunate enough to get the best wax specialist on my very first visit. Kami has been awesome and I have continued to see her ever since. I have gone to other places and the service doesn't even compare. \n\nEuropean wax center staff are very professional. Courteous. And knowledgeable. \n\nKeep it up and thanks for the great service.
