Love this location, I always have a good experience here . The employees are always friendly and they're never stingy with their chicken lol. The biggest complaint I've seen for this location is the lines. You may have to wait in line for a little bit but that's only because it's one of the only 24 hour subways in Mesa. If people were a little more patient I'm sure this location would have more better reviews!
