I was in Vegas for a quick getaway trip and since I'm a huge crawfish fanatic, I had to try a couple places here in Vegas. My first spot was Hot and Juicy crawfish on the strip. Overall it was great but after I had a taste of Urban Crawfish Starion, it was amazing. H&L flavor was good but the garlic was  too overwhelming for me. Urban Crawfish is probably the best crawfish place in Vegas! And not to mention the great customer service!
