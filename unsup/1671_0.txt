Sushi reminiscent of what I'm used to and grew up on in Los Angeles. It took us a while to find really good authentic sushi in Glendale. This is our favorite sushi spot!  We love to hit it up on Friday nights and have some Saki!  Definitely love the Orgasm and What the Heck rolls!  I really love the Ahi poke bowl too. The service is great and personal. They remember you here!
