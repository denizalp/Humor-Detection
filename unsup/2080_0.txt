Preppy pet is the best day care and pet resort in the valley ! The truly care about each and every pet that goes in their facility. Sue runs a very clean professional environment that is pet friendly for sure . We were unfortunate enough to be stuck in a hotel for two months and her business provided a great place to keep my little Westie  Highland Terrier happy and healthy. My dog is only stayed during the day for day care so far however I won't hesitate to keep my dog there when I go on vacation.
