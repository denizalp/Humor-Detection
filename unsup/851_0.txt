THE VERY BEST MACARONS I HAVE EVER TASTED. They were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD! Slap your Momma. Go to Church CRAZY GOOD!  Little bite sized wonders of not the ordinary flavors. I LOVED THE Savory Thai Curry Macarons, Tikka Masala macarons, and Rosemary and Cheve Macarons. I was told soon Whole Foods will carry them and I was told AJ's carries them. I have never tasted a French Macaron that was so transforming as these from Aunt Abby before!\n\nSmoke a cigarette good even if you don't smoke good!\n\nReally REALLY good!
