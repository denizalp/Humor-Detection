Blanco Tacos and Tequila is the worst of the worst of airport restaurants\/bars. The only redeeming quality is that the staff was nice and did not screw up the order.\n\nFor 14 dollars I had Tamale Chicken plate and a bottled water. In the Styrofoam tray it was nothing but a siring hot, melted cheese pile with disgusting chicken and over cooked rice. The equivalent to a school meal at 3 times the price. I would not suggest eating here for the horrible food.
