Was contacted by some creep who works here after I posted my car for sale on Craigslist. His number is 909-645-5578. His name might be Frank Adams.  He texted me various times despite my asking him not to.  He was trying to convince me to come into the dealership. If they employ shady guys like this,  I can't imagine this is a place to trust for a car purchase.
