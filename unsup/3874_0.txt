I found multiple glass shards in a salmon filet purchased from CostCo. I've been trying to get them to contact me about this for almost a week. The only response I get is various form responses telling me to come in for a refund. At this point I've had to file a complaint with WI DATCP (Food safety people).\n\nMy wife and I literally ate glass and CostCo doesn't appear to care at all.
