As always customer service at any JW Marriott is outstanding!  I started with the spinach & artichoke dip which was great.  I then had the Hawthorn burger which was slightly above average. It was a little undercooked for my taste as I ordered medium well.  \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience and pretty decent food. I would definitely recommend you give it a try if staying in the hotel.
