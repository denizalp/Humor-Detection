Great cheese section, terrific butchery and foshmonger, lots of bulk items and a grocery section that is designed for the higher end shopper who likes organic range free ethically sourced etc. I don't know if I'd be able to afford a full weekly shop here, but it's certainly possible.\n\nThe store is big (bigger than the one in Southpark) and there's plenty of parking.
