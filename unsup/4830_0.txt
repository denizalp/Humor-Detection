Nice place inside and good food selection but they have the slowest service ever. There were around 20 people in the whole restaurant and our to go lunch order took 40-45 minutes. The excuse was that it got busy all of a sudden, lame. It's Father's Day on a Sunday and I can't imagine how much slower it'll be later on. Another party walked out to the front to pay their bill because they had to go and their service was slow too!
