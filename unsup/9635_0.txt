Mention yelp and get a one hour full body massage for $34. Not the cheapest I've had, but way worth the money. Typical Chinese massage place, shady on the outside one of the cleanest on the inside. Nice people. Let them know your desired pressure- its pretty hard. Starts with a feet soak in Chinese medicine. Then an upper back massage while sitting up. Then to the head and neck, feet and calves. Then the recliner becomes a massage table and they turn you over do your lower back. Would definitely go back!
