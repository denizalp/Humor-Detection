Pizzeria Bianco what?\n\nOh, you wait 5 hours to get the pizza I get in 20 minutes.  That's cool.  The owner doesn't have free time to come and chat with you?  That's too bad.  \n\n:)\n\nIn all seriousness, I do love pizzeria bianco, but this place is better.  Hand tossed, wood fired, fresh mozzarella , delicious proscuitto, fresh arugula.  I might have to go back tonight.    Their pizza is delicious.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for some awesome pizza.
