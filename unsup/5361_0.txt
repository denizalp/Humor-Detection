The food here was really good! I had the shrimp basket, Garlic bread with pepperoni, slice of pepperoni pizza, and mozzarella sticks. The tab was $22.00 which was very reasonable, and the service was fast. The only thing that could use some work was the energy in the store ( a little low energy, maybe some music.) but that aside I recommend this place.
