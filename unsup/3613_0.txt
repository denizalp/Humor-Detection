We came on a super busy Sunday morning and decided to sit at the breakfast bar. So glad we did! Austin helped us and was super awesome!! He recommended our food a different way and it came out amazing! So glad we decided to sit here. Thanks Austin for being awesome! Service was on point today and food was amazing
