It's a public hospital, not a hotel. \nRemember that.\n\nThe Friendly and hard working staff, always made my trips there as easy as possible given the circumstances. \nThey have some lovely volunteers who help ppl find their way around the building and make sure the blood taking clinic is running as smoothly as possible by giving ppl direction as they enter. \nI talked to a medical student who said it was one of the best places In the city for residency.
