this place is amazing! as long as you like your desserts extremely sweet and unhealthy. i usually go for the donut ice cream sandwiches and man they're impressive!!! they incorporate cereal in everything which is my favorite part about this place you can't go wrong with with some ice cream in between some macaroons either. i don't think there's anything here i wouldn't recommend 10\/10
