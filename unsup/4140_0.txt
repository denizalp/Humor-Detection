I recently moved from California to AZ, let me tell you , I am really picky about my nails. I had tried two other nails salon but none of them made me happy until I found relaxing nails.They took their time working on my nails, they listen to my concern. Loc, he is amazing, my nails look fantastic. Super friendly staff, I will be back and highly recommend this management.Thank you for making my nails look so beautiful.
