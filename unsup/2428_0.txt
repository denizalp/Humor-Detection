Just had some good ole Marcos Pizza one of the better pizza places we have around this area. The delivery guy was pretty cool and even wished us a Happy Thanksgiving! Whenever I think pizza this is one of the places that always come to mind for a very good quality pizza pie. Papa Murphys can't even shake a stick at Marcos. If you want less greasy, good for the family style pizza go ahead and give Marcos a try, you won't regret it.
