I went here for a late morning snack with a friend during the week. The place looks great & it's clean. The employees are good but unremarkable.\n\nWe shared the evivva breakfast sandwich & it was really good. As we weren't really hungry splitting was a good idea. The home fries were ok but would have needed some herbs to jazz them up. They didn't give us a hard time for sharing the meal which was nice.\n\nOverall ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.
