The location is good, and the patio can be wonderful on a winter afternoon.  The food, however, seems to be about 20% overpriced for what you receive.  It isn't bad, mind you, but it certainly isn't worth the prices they charge.  The bar area gets very, very crowded on Friday nights, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're in the mood for.  It is a nice place for drinks, and maybe appetizers.  Skip it for dinner, though, and try someplace else within walking distance in old town Scottsdale.
