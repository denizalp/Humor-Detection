you simply cannot go wrong with Chompies. if you can't find anything to eat here, you may as well go home and eat cereal.\nThe breakfast alone is reason enough. the portions are huge....enough for take home bags. And everything from sweet to savory is on the menu. I used to crave the pastrami sandwiches because they are perfectly constructed and again....gigantic. this place does not skimp.\nif you're not dining in, the bakery alone is reason to visit. not only are the items superbly tasty, but they are beautiful!\nservice has always been great as well.
