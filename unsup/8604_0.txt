Sugar Bowl makes for a great hot afternoon treat. Between the ice cream and arcade, you can't ask for a better day and there's no age limit to enjoy it! Yes, there is an arcade and it has ski ball, the basketball game, air hockey and some other games. You can get tokens and win tickets for a prize. It's perfect if you have children and are looking for something to do and it's even fun if you are an adult and want to relive your childhood one day.
