An old bldg with torn up furniture! Came to tour for my father.  I was disgusted with how badly they openly treat their staff which made me wonder how they would treat my father! Most of the pple there didnt seem very happy or friendly!!! Not a place I would even want to be at much less send my pops to! The other facilities are a few miles out of the way but they seemed so much nicer and caring!!! and they are INSIDE a hospital unlike this dump (Promise).
