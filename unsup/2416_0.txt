The gentleman who gave me a pedicure was angry at my feet. It was definitely painful but I anticipate they'll look good after they heal.  Nine out of 10 toes have visible wounds. The massage chair attempted to violate me. It was the first chair I have experienced that attacks your butt hole.  No intended humor, it's a fact.
