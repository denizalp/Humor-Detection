Casual cozy and overall a good experience. Our party had to sit outside where it became a bit warm even tho we had a reservation.  Facing parked cars wasn't what we expected. Toast was extra which I thought was a bit unusual, but everyone seemed to to be pleased with what they ordered.\nWould recommend as a casual fare.
