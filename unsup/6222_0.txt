We relocated from San Francisco last year and Paul and Heidi at Mc Cormick Ranch Postal are great. He is like the Mayor of McCormick Ranch. Always greets us warmly and holds the mail while we are away. Heidi even calls us on the cell phone when a package is delivered. Now this is customer service! Love these guys!
