Service was horrendous. Our server had no idea what he was doing. We did the hibachi and never got soup or salad, took 25 minutes for drinks to arrive, and another 15 for the check. Upon  receiving the check there was 18% gratuity already included. Never an apology for no soup or salad. Amateur hour all around.
