Allis is possibly the best hairstylist I've had. Ever. She is so talented and knowledgeable, but that's just her professional side. Her lovely personality and demeanor will keep me coming back again and again. She's a hair Master that knows her stuff! I highly recommend her services, no matter what you want, she will make you look like the Goddess you are.
