Came here with a friend for both of our first times. Were matcha fans & found this place through Yelp. Based off good ratings, being matcha lovers, the big crowd, clean & cute interior, & etc etc, we came here with high expectations. We ordered a parfait & frappeccino. Both tasted like the matcha wasnt artificial, so we were impressed at first. Everything tasted okay... However about 30-45 mins after, my friend began vomiting the frap. It wasn't until later when I also experienced an uneasy stomach. Great concept, but sad to say, we won't be returning here!
