I took my partner for his birthday there last night for dinner and drinks. It was such a waste of time and money!! The server was slow and the food was horrible! We had the super gooey chimmy and it was almost raw. What a way to ruin a birthday dinner. Thanks Gringos!!!! Never will I ever go again and will spread the word!!
