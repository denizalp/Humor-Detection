BAD! BAD!! BAD!!!\n\nI read reviews on Yelp recommending this but I was beyond disappointed.\n\nI ordered the House Special Spicy. (Beef, Pork, Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice) with Breaded Shrimp and Spring Rolls, they all tasted horrible and it wasn't cheap.\n\nI should have ordered from my regular spot with fast delivery and very good tasty food (New Ho King)\n\nAlso, they delivered my food late. Never ordering from here again. NEVER EVER!
