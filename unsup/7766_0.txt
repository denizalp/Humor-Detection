Pre-Review Note to New Yorkers: We KNOW. We GET IT. There is no good pizza outside of NY. I agree. Moving on...\n\nI like NYPD Pizza because you don't have to order pizza in order to have a good meal. The salads are great. My fave is the Chelsea Salad. The Italian Wedding Soup is also very good. The pastas are pretty good and I'm not really into tomato sauce. \n\nThe Pizza is okay. Yes, New Yorkers are going to hate on it and call it crap, but is it not?
