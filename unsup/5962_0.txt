Cold shit, is how I would describe the meal. Ice cold prepared sides they left under the warmer. Wanted a drink until we watched the bartender pulling olives with her bare hands. Maybe if we weren't white the hostess would have treated us better instead of throwing the menus and silverware on the table and walking away. Then again the entire staff was rude.
