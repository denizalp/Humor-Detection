You know this is probably one of the best clubs in Las Vegas when it has 4.5 stars and over 1400 reviews. half a star over Marquee definitely tells you its something better. \n\nCons: Bouncers were douches. \n\nPros: Bartenders know how to make drinks. You can walk outside gamble and get free drinks. great music. They even played the angry bird song theme song and made it flow. \n\nHot girls on sunday night. \n\nThe club is so beautiful. There's a pool. I love partying until the 4 am.
