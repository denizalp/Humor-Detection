I'm giving this place two stars for being clean and the hostess was really friendly. I went there for full face wax only to leave with barely any hair removed, just to be clear my facial hair is not a lot and was long enough to be removed. The technician insisted that she did her best and I would have to wait for my hair to be longer. I'm sitting home now doing the work myself. I wish I had a better experience.
