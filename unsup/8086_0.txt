The good?  The food was delicious.  The bad? It's pretty spendy.  The lobster bisque was DELISH as was the smoked scallop under glass - but at $9 a pop, it'll leave you wanting.  Drinks were also tasty.  \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned the cigar smell and we noticed it too.  It is unfortunately pretty off-putting to smell that while you're eating.  I'm guessing eating outside might be better?
