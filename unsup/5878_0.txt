We tried this location a couple of years ago and it was just OK. We went back this week and everything was fantastic! Our server Cody did a great job taking care of us. We had a Cesar salad, cheese garlic bread, stuffed mushroom ravioli and a thin crust veggie pizza. EVERYTHING was perfect and made just right! Amazing and complete opposite of our last experience. Forgot to mention the pizookie (freshly baked chocolate cookie and a mini pizza pan with your choice of ice cream scooped on top :):):):) DELICIOUS!
