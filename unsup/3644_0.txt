dear sokolowski's,\ngod bless you and your perogis.  best meal i had while i was home. the judges gave it 4.5, 5, and 5.  the only reason that first judge gave it a 4.5 was because she didn't get to you sooner.  if she would have, there would have been more trips.  unfortunately, the judge waited until the second to last day she was home to visit you and your culinary godliness.\n\nshe won't make that mistake again.\n\nyou can do no wrong, sokolowski's.  no wrong at all.
