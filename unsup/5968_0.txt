It's hard to really fault this place. The pizza is so good and the prices are totally down to earth for what you're getting. There are a few places in the upper echelon of pizza making the Valley of the Sun, but, this is one of them. There's not much room for seating so try to get there a bit early if you're trying to dodge a crowd.
