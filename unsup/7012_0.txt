I got a bouquet of flowers from here for my wife just because.  The service was friendly and the flowers look pretty good too.  My only complaint would be that the bouquet was freaking 4 feet long!  I didn't realize the bouquet was going to be a freaking tree!  Anyways, cutting the stems made everything just fine.
