This is the best all you can eat sushi in Las, Vegas hands down. The best time to eat is dinner time if you like uni, toro, bluefin, and sweet shrimp. I would suggest to come early for dinner because it can get busy. I believe they close at 3 am but their last seating for all you can eat sushi is at 2 am so plan accordingly.\n\nService is usually pretty prompt. Sit at the sushi bar if you want to know all the better cuts of fish for the day. The sushi chefs are cool.
