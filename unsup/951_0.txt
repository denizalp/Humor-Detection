Just mind-blowing! Had my hair done by Joel (owner\/stylist). He was able to squeezed me in last minute as i was from out of town.He first consulted and explains his vision. I love my hair, and usually afraid to change. I've been wanting a makeover for the longest time. Joel gave me an edgy cut and colors that was perfect. \nIf u are looking for a change, a mind-blowing cut, Joel is the man! He also showed me how to style when I'm home. Everyone was so nice. Am so happy.
