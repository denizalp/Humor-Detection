Was here for easter Sunday and what a treat! Pastor Anderson is a great man of God and his hard preaching is essential in our anti biblical world. We are seriously considering relocating just so we can be members of this great congregation. If your looking for a King James Bible believing, hard preaching, soul winning, active church there is no better than Faithful Word Baptist.
