Update: 9\/7\/2017 \nDirty, sloppy, one slob kabob making drinks.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad an issue with a young sassy girl...\n\nI watched her pour cow milk into my husbands unsweetened iced latte.\n\nShe actually got super shitty with me to the point her manager came out of the office and remade both my drinks.\n\nShe needs an attitude adjustment. Slinging drinks around in a sassy rushed way is not very Starbucks to me.\n\nShe won't last long.
