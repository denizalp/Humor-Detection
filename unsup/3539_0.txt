This by far the worst steak 'n shake I have EVER been to. I have been staying in the hooters hotel and coming here at least once every single day just for the convenience. Every single time has been nothing but slow, terrible service and extremely mediocre food compared to every other steak 'n shake I have been to.... not to mention flat sodas. Don't waste your time going here... you get what you pay for.
