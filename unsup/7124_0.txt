Had a bad experience when I saw them mistakenly gave my order to a guest eating at the table and started to get their first bite and the cashier said sorry that one is not your order and put that order somewhere in the back for a minute then putting it in my order to go plastic bag that they thought I wasn't watching. They gave me my order and I stop and said, I saw what you guys did. Please make me a fresh one.  They didn't even apologize or offered something.
