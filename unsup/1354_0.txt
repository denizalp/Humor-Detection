Joe has been doing my pool cleaning for about a year. He is very professional at what he does. The service is excellent. The Price is Right.  He is consistently on time and as someone you can trust to have around your house. His rate includes all chemicals necessary to keep your pool looking great. I did not need him to take care of a troubled green water pool but I know he can do that also. He also does some mechanical work if necessary.
