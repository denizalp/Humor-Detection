My first time there... I got the Meat Jun (Beef) and it was very good.  I would order it again.  Then again... I like to try different entrees, so who knows.  The place was casual, nothing spectacular, the wait staff was quick  and friendly.  Pricing was very reasonable.  I'd go back without hesitation.
