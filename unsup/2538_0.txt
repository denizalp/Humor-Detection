Awesome classic burger shop.  Ordered the 6oz burger with chilli fries and they were fantastic.  The orders are prepared fresh right in front of you.  \n\nThis place has some of the best unique toppings to add to your burger including a house Magoos sauce and bruschetta.  \n\nOnly complaint is that they only serve Pepsi products for drinks.
