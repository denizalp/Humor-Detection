This place is so fun! I love wandering the isles here. It's a very clean and organized  store. It smells good too. Probably the candles and potpourri. \nThey carry all kinds of pictures, mirrors, bedding, pillows, glass wear, kitchen gadgets, plates, home decor, seasonal decor.....etc etc.  \nIts fun to check the clearance shelves, too. I have found some really cool things there. \nIf you need something for that extra touch for your home or need a great gift to give, this place may be your new stomping ground. Lol \nCome in and check it out
