The food here is mediocre.  The entrees come out all swimming in melted cheese.  Its hard to differentiate the individual foods, just like every other mexican place. Why is this the norm?   A very small pitcher of sangria cost $16 and this was nothing special too.  Could make better at home.  Quality like this makes me just want to cook and drink at home.  Even blast some mariachi music too!
