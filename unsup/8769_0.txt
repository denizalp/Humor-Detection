Meh. You can make this shite at home.\n\nMethinks the whole Euroallure of waffles + ice cream got the white liberal elites sucking on Brexit's tit, begging England to stay...\n\nBring cash. Place is expensive. I know ya gotta Regatta but cot damn Eddie Huang, EU-Eggo waffle with one scoopa ICLite + tip left me as broke as the panhandlers outside. \n\nPlace is kinda girly. Good for pwhipped date nite. Wish they offered Plan B azza topping, but they don't...
