Different 'ice cream'! This was a great experience and I loved watching the guy mix and make our orders! He was very friendly, explained the menu and was patience! I had the peanut butter with walnuts, Reese's, cheesecake and chocolate sauce and it was yummy although i could not taste the cheesecake. My mom had the pumpkin spice and she said it was underwhelming and too gooey! Will definitely try other flavors when we are back in town!
