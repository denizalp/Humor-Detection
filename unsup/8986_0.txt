Coming on a week day makes it a WHOLE lot easy to get in. And not as crowded (which is fine with me.) \n\nOnly the outside area was really open however, the pool and the poker tables are pretty cool.  People can really go swimming in the pool it's crazy! \n\nJust be careful some areas around the pool are really small and you feel like you could fall in just by walking by.  *tip toe*  :P
