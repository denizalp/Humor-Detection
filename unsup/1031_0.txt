I was very unimpressed with this place. Its cheap sushi which is red flag number one and they also have an all you can eat sushi buffet red flag number two. My fiance and I went here during the all you can eat buffet and I could not even eat my sushi. It was warm and smelled fishy. I guess if you are a person who is not the biggest sushi fan and enjoy cheap fried sushi this place could work for you.
