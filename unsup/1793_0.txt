****0 STARS****\n\nINSULTED AND OFFENDED IS AND UNDERSTATEMENT.... \n\nThey got me with the sign at the door. No big purses, big jackets, or groups bigger than 2 at a time.... It's APSURD... Because I carry a big ass Louis Vuitton purse, I have to lock it up or keep it in my car. NOT ALL PEOPLE STEAL. Some actually WORK HARD for their money and are honest. \n\nSHAME ON YOU PEOPLE.
