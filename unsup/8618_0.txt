I've eaten a several All You Can Eat sushi places. This one is at the bottom of the list. The sushi was on the low end quality side. The cooked items weren't anything to rave about either. The brie and grape quesadilla was strange to see on the menu. I tried it and it was LAME. \n\nPROS: Cool inside interior\n            Super cool employees\n\nCONS: Quality
