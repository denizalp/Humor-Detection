Oreganos has thoroughly disappointed me.\n\nI love their fun atmosphere and bringing out of town guests here. The food isn't super consistent, but it can be a decent place to get some dinner. Unfortunately...they just removed my favorite item from their menu. =( Goodbye Big Ol' Ravioli...you may have been a bit greasy and overly sauced, but I enjoyed you. \n\nI'll probably be back at some point, but not soon. Big bummer!
