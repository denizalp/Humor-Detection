This is the only place that you can get Rock Bottom brewed beer.  They depend on it for their distribution.  Beers are good.  The few I had were on the heavier side.  The food was general southern American.  Battered, greasy and heavy.  They have a 2200 calorie slice of carrot cake on the menu??  2200?  My advice grab some beers, skip he food.
