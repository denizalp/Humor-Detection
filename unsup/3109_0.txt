The place was clean, the wait staff attentive and the food was good. \n\nI tried the pizza, it was a small personal sized thing with plenty of toppings and cheese. It totally hit the spot. \n\nThe price was great too. I think it was less then $5. \n\nThe captain and coke was poured perfectly and complimented my pizza! LOL\n3.5 stars
