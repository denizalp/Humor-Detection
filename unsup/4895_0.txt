Friendliest staff! Their pricing is affordable and the quality of service you get is well worth it. Every time I come in everyone is attentive and welcoming, they have a huge variety of colors and designs and they stay open later than most nail shops which in my option is a huge plus! Definitely would recommend his place they do a amazing job!
