I thought this was a restaurant, but apparently it's just a hobby.\n\nDrove half an hour out of my way to a sign saying they were closed \"due to a family emergency.\" Reading through other reviews, this is not an isolated incident and apparently happens with a fair amount of frequency. \n\nWe don't live in a communist country (yet)-  no one is mandating your hours. If you can't keep your own business hours, you should probably change them to something you CAN commit to.\n\nIf this were a one-time thing, I'd be inclined to be sympathetic- but clearly it isn't.
