We came here mainly for the drinks. Food was ehhh but the worse of it all was the wait time. We waited about 45 mins for food and the server only checked up on us once in between. Drinks were on the sweet side but tolerable. All in all, the only time we go to margaritaville is when we're in vegas as a tradition. Probably will stop that soon....
