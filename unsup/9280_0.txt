We used to call this place Tons of Sluts.\nBecause pretty much, that's what it is.  \nThere's a fence that fences you into the bar... it's.. ridiculous. \nIt's not cheap.\nI only went for drag shows.  But if you're looking for a wild drag show and cheap drinks head to Blue Moon in L-Ville on Butler Street
