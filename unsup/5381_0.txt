Tried to go back two days in a row it was that good, unfortunately it was closed on Sunday. By the time we got there they were out of their famous poached egg Panini, so we went with the Cajun spiced chicken with guacamole, mango and roasted tomato. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Husband and I also split an almond croissant which was nothing short of incredible, and the lattes and drip coffee were great as well. HIGHLY recommend, the wait to eat here is worth it.
