Eh, I should have listened to the reviews saying you need more cheese. We ordered a sicilian to go and while it was decent, it 100% needed more cheese. It wasn't as thick as the sicilian pizza I used to get back home, but it was good enough. I'd definiately go back, but I'd get extra cheese this time.\nPrices and service were good, so no complaints there!
