It was my first time coming in here last night (Tuesday) and it definitely gave me a good first impression!! Service was fast, we got seated and served right away. They played EDM in the background, which is a good thing because I like EDM. On to the food, I ordered, think it was beef ball noodle soup (a Vietnamese pho) and I loved it. Our server (David) was so nice and helpful, he made sure we got what we needed like extra bowls, forks, etc since we split some of our dishes. We'll def come back!
