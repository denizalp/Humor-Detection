Holy crap this place rocks...Think Panera on steroids and you've got a good idea of what to expect at Wildflower!\n\nI came here and ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, and was shocked at how two seemingly odd flavors combined together so beautifully.  The blueberry compote was the cherry (or I guess blueberry) on top, and the perfect finish to these deliciously fluffy creations!  Service was with a smile, despite my drooling while looking their menu up and down...\n\nNext time I'm back in AZ, I'll surely be returning for their appetizing lunch soups\/sandwiches too!
