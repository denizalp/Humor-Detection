Went into the Swizzle Inn last night to say hi to one of my favorite bartenders Crystal.  If not for her, I would never go into that bar again.  I was having a private conversation with two other gentlemen at the bar when the owner comes up to me and I quote \"you're a puke!\"  I said \"excuse me?\" and she repeated it.  Not cool to be stupid drunk in your own bar lady.
