This place came recommended by a local food tour and I suggest they retract the recommendation. The menu offers a few random options, none very impressive. We also found the cocktail and wine list unimpressive.  To add to all this, the bartender actually laughed at me for mispronouncing a French word; the only time I've encountered such rudeness by Montr√©al servers. I'll be surprised if this place lasts.
