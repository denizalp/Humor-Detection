La Jawab is good for a casual family dinner with great tasting food. It's not a fine dining atmosphere - but booths and tables are great and clean. Big and spacious place\n\nYou order your food at the counter and sit at your table to be served. The selection isn't as vast as your average indian restaurant. I feel though, the quality is good.  The food is amazing, the staff is friendly enough!  Their Kebabs, chicken and vegetarian options are all delicious.  Their Chicken Karahi is the best! It's fast and delicious - most times.
