Love the Yelp special.  A cup of posele, loaded with pork in a light green chile broth, topped with fresh red onion, radish, and cabbage with baked chips on the side.  Fish tacos were crispy nuggets of joy.  Flavorful fish, hot and flaky, topped with cabbage, fresh avocado sliced, pico and light spicy ajoili.  Gnocchi was light clouds of ricotta topped with shredded pork, spinach and parmesian.  Dinner was completed with a great Napa cab sold by the glass at a reasonable price.  Wonderful meal$
