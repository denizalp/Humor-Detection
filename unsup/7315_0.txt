I love this little random-ass place that sells beer, munchies, and is directly on my drive home from work. Anytime I get the hankering for beef jerky or my weekly bag of Combos, I know where to go. \n\nThis is the kind of place that used to be on every street corner back in the day, but closed due to the advent of sixteen Giant Eagles every square mile in the Cleveland area.
