Greeted at the door by a chef as he was hugging goodbye the patrons leaving his restaurant. \nOrdered lumpia, chicken masala, truffle risotto with veggies and lemon cake with ice cream. Delicious, but pricey for Hendo. We'll continue to support this business as the food, atmosphere and grateful staff make for a great date night treat.
