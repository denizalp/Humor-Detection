Going to the Malt House on a recentish trip to Madison really made me miss living in Wisconsin.  It's not like there aren't places with large beer selections in Champaign, IL, but there's nothing that compares to the Malt House.  This bar has beer selection coming out of its hoohah.  It's overwhelming and intoxicating (on more than one level)--and if I hadn't just gotten done driving for four hours, I would've wanted to stay and drink and talk to the sassy staff all night long.  Some day, Malt House...some day.
