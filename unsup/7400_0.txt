I love their pizza!But today I ordered 3 pizzas online and when I went to pick them up I waited ...They set 3 pizzas up and I asked the worker there if they were mine and she said no without even checking so I waited 15 more minutes and asked again and she checked and it turned out they were my pizzas !!! So they were sitting there all along getting cold and the woman didn't even apologize or offer to remake them!unbelievable! So again I love their pizza but their customer service needs work!
