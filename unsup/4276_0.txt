My sister and I decided to go one morning and try something new out. We were both so nervous because we have never tried aerial before , but during the class I have never felt so relaxed. Amber and Brandi are so sweet and patient and are so willing to help. I never felt overwhelmed or scared! I can't wait to take another class :))))
