Scottsdale on a Friday night without reservations - if you're a local, you know what I'm talking about. So it was a delight to get an outdoor table here relatively quickly, despite how busy Kelly's was. Service was fairly prompt.  We had the Golden State Pepperjack Burger and the Kelly's Classic. The Classic was amazing! Both the burgers were 100% Angus Brisket Blend. Pretty sure the Classic was the best burger I've ever had!
