First time I went with the family my mother got sick a few hours later. The second time I went was with friends and a friend and myself got sick a few hours later. The only reason there was a third is because my girlfriend worked there and she brought me a fish sandwich meal at work, except there was no fish on the bread, literally just bread and lettuce. Seems to intentional to just happen by chance, which shows me the lack of maturity of staff and leadership by the managers.
