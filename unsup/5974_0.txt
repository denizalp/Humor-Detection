I ate here yesterday. I waited 45 minutes for a great pizza. I saw the guy at the front counter stealing tips, so I gave mine straight to the waitress. She looked scared and tucked it quickly into her apron. I wanted to tell management , but had too many other things to take care of. The desserts look pretty so they get an extra star.
