Wow, this must be the flagship Lee's sandwich store. It's huge and sells all kinds of Vietnamese products from butter to kids jellies and from coffee beans to sugar cane juice. Soon to come are slots and video poker machines. So, you can have the perfect cure for a night of debauchery hangover, Banh Mi sandwich with jalapenos, sirracha sauce and a Ice Coffee and continue to gamble too. If your driving back home you have to get a couple of BBQ Pork or Special Combo #11 sandwiches for the road.
