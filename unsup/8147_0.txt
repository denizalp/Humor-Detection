This place is tried and true. They don't \"run out of boba,\" which is so very devastating once you've committed to the idea. They have flavors for every preference. \n\nI don't like slushy drinks. I rarely get iced milk teas. I come here for two, consistently good things: hot rose milk tea and their \"hot healthy drink\/dessert\" taro soup with taro balls and red bean. \n\nFun fact: I was feel adventurous and tried Lavender. That may be someone's preference, but I felt like I was drinking soothing-nighttime-lotion. Lavender has no other association for me.
