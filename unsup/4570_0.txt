Delux introduced Phoenix to the super good gourmet burger and the Vig has successfully taken it to another level.  The Vig Azz is the burger that I think Dave Thomas and Ray Kroc probably eat up in heaven.  The other dishes are good as well.\n\nThe vibe is LA pretentious cool so just pretend to be hip when you get your super tasty burger.
