I have taken my Audi here on a few occasions and they did honest work.  If you are considering bringing your car here to be serviced, do yourself a favor and call around to some of the German car specialists in the area for prices.  I found a huge difference in the pricing saving me $200 for an $80 service, at a certified Audi repair shop.  When I called them back to advise them of the insane overpricing they replied that they didn't really care what I thought.  Now, off for a nice steak dinner with my savings!!
