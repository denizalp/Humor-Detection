Location is great to old town and the atmosphere is nice, modern and a little trendy. \nFood was honestly just ok. We had 2 of the most adorable tacos. They were tiny and ok . The chicken burrito was pretty good but nothing earth shattering.  You have to pay for chips and salsa which were quite good and well I just wasn't blown away.\nGood luck with the men's room!
