I hate this shared bus crap. Is it just me, or is the airport actually closer to the Las Vegas Strip than this rent-a-car center?\n\nToo much walking, too many buses and too long a ride. Just like Baltimore and Seattle and others where you get on a shared bus with everyone else and their luggage, regardless of whether or not you have any status with your car rental company.\n\nI think next time, I'll just get a danged taxi.
