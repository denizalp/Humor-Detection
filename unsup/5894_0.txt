Well today I find myself back at Il Capo Pizzaria for the third time this week. If u call that a relapse then i'm definitely a Capoholic. Happy hour is the best in the area and the quality of food is epically priced! And a great selection of beers and wines to intertwine the dining experience. The only thing missing from this place is a glamour shot of puppies and kittens on the wall to seal the deal. For those who don't know... Now u know! Don't miss out! A gem of Scottsdale. Shout out to the sauce boss!
