Only place in Verona worth eating in my book (that's not the Epic cafeteria). Best meatloaf ever (a little spicy, great sides). Really good sandwiches. Only complaint is the cold sides don't usually do it for me. OK, and that they took away the beer and bacon brussel sprouts hot side which was fantastic.\n\nThe portion sizes for sandwiches are smaller than you might expect, which only reduces them to the appropriate size in my opinion, but if you want a lot of food for your money, you may not feel like you got a good deal.
