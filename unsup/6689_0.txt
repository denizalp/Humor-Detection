When you get in a cab and a copy of Mein Kampf is on the dash it's probably a bad sign. Driver was terrible and a racist. I asked him about it since I know some people read it for historical reference or educational reasons but he ignored me. You want to wear that as a badge of pride on your dash for everyone to see that's your business but it seems pretty stupid if you want to get tips.  Drivers name was Mason Craddock.
