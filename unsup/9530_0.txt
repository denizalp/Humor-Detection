This review is mostly for their chocolate chocolate chip pancakes. Every time I go to a breakfast place and they have a double chocolate pancake type of thing I have to get it. I'm obsessed with chocolate anything. The one here beats every standard breakfast place that serves it! It's a must have for people with a sweet tooth. I highly recommend eating here if you have the chance.
