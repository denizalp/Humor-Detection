The low prices and large selection aren't worth the hassle. Woodman's is *not* for people who aren't getting there by car. I got hit by a car crossing the street legally in front of Woodman's. When we bussed or biked over there, they demanded we leave our backpacks with customer service to do our shopping (we're nearly 30 year old adults), even after protesting that our laptops were in them.\n\nIt's not clean, it's crowded, a lot of the produce is old and rotting.
