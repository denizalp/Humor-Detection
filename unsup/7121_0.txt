H & M is Swedish, folks, just like Ikea. So, they have tons of cheap stuff, just like Ikea. They have all shapes and sizes, just like Ikea. The stuff looks cheap, most of the time, with a few exceptional items... just like Ikea. \n\nIf you see a dress on every third girl on the street, and everyone seems to own the same top, it's H & M, no doubt. Come to think of it, it's like Ikea in that way with furniture that everyone has the same chair and glasses and plates. \n\nUnlike Ikea, no meatballs.
