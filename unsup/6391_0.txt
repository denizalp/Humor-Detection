Pirates, thank you for making me believe again and prompting me to watch my first live baseball game in 24 years. Your club has made great strides since my last review in 2010, making the playoffs after a bad streak 2 decades long. The last two games were heartbreakers, but yinz have nothing to be ashamed of for this season was something to build on. I predict greatness and dynasties in the future. Ahoy maties!!!\n\nP.S. THIS should be your new rallying song...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Q91-999gEM
