The Bamboo Pool is located on the 14th floor in the West Tower. This is a much more quieter pool versus the Boulevard Pool. It's smaller but still a good size to hang out in. If you want some peace and quiet without obnoxious college kids around....this is a good alternative. They serve the same food & beverage menu here along with the Boulevard Pool. I saw people here of all ages...all different shapes and sizes. So don't be body conscious....this isn't like the dayclub scene.
