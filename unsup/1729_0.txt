I bought my wedding dress from Nina in early spring of last year. She was great helping me find the perfect dress ata great price. We had been planning a fall wedding. At the last minute on a Thursday, we decided to get married the next Wednesday. She was fabulous getting my alterations done. She worked her schedule so she could get me in after hours because that was the only timei could meet her, and she worked till late in the night to get everything perfect. I couldn't have asked fora better experience.
