Over all this is my favorite Apple Store in Las Vegas. Even when the store is busy, the associates are very attentive and they try to help you as fast as possible. This is the location I schedule all my genius appointments at and my experience is always great. (Quick,efficient, and helpful.) \n\nAs far as products, I'm an avid fan of Apple so I'm not going to go into that but I will say that be back to this location and I will always recommend this location to anybody who needs Apple products or services.
