I've just moved to the area and have been looking for a nice place to get my nails done. There are so many locations making it hard to decide. So, I just went for it and picked Baxter Nails and Spa. What a good choice! This was by far the BEST salon. My nail stylist was Lyn. I could tell she was a perfectionist when it came to nails. She was very diligent and truly talented. I will be back!
