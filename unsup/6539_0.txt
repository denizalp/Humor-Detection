Wow. Clubbing in Vegas is at a whole new level. Not that I really go clubbing here in the city but still. It's crazy. We came here to celebrate the celebrant of the night (BP). People everywhere. Hot. (as in it's getting hot in here--but please don't take off your clothes--although a lot of people would have). Drunk people. Alcohol. No room to move. It was definitely an experience. Our group sat down for a bit because our feet hurt from wearing heels and so we just giggling at all the drunk people. That was fun.
