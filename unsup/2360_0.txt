Firstly, Paoli is such a cute, little community that is really fun to visit. Secondly, Creamery Cafe is a great place to eat! You can sit outside along a pretty stream and enjoy the wonderful food that's been prepared for you. The menu and specials are alwasy interesting and made with local ingredients. I can't wait to go back!
