If you are going to offer gluten free pizza crust you should probably know what that is when customers ask for it!  If you are going to offer Tecate beer, again, you should probably know what that is!  If you need a specific person to put on the veggies, they should probably be working their spot in the service line and not answering phones.  We waited a good 5 minutes for our veggies.  Customer service was clueless!  Pizza was good and the restaurant was clean but I don't think I would be likely to return anytime soon.
