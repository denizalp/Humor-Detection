I don't get the hype. It's definitely an Americanized sushi joint. Most things are fried, baked and\/or swimming in sauce....\n\nI enjoy sushi for the delicate flavors of fresh fish. The pieces of the rolls are HUGE, so you can't fit the entire piece in your mouth easily (that's what she said).\n\nIt'll do if I am in suburbia. But overall, there are better places.
