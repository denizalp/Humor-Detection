Food is disgusting. They sent me fries with old cheese it smelled gross, I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. The chicken was dry and old. Worse food ever. Don't order here. The people wouldn't refund me, thank god for eat 24. They refunded me money. Yet the so called manager refused to speak with me. Horrible service , I will be calling the health department. I'm certified in food safety and they are serving unsafe food. Needs to be shut down asappppppp!!!!
