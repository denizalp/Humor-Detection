I've been staying at the (attached) Best Western the last three nights for a film festival.\nAnd haven't eaten anywhere else.\nHaven't really needed to.\nThe menu, and execution, here is too good to prompt wandering.  Not to mention the staff is amazing, the beer selection's great, awesome patio, they have a cozy, stylish room for live music....\nProps and thanks, Tap!!
