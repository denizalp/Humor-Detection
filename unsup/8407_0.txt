Worst service ever! Once you walk in it's an awkward silence and all they do is stare at you.....3rd time is the charm never coming back here again. I'm guessing I'm invisible or something or maybe they just profile people to see if it's worth their time to speak to you .....no one helped me out all 3 times I've gone to this place wanting to buy some firearms. Missed out on big sales $$$
