Hi everyone, I was visiting from Cali for the weekend. Had a chance to try this place, with the Family. Really friendly and great service. We showed up almost around closing with quite a bit of people, but the gentleman was very welcoming. Pizza is really good. Big slices. The chicken wings are a must. One of the best chicken wings I've had(medium buffalo).  We were helped out by a fine young gentlemen which I believe was the owner. Definitely should check this place out. Thank you again, hope you all get to try it. Enjoy!
