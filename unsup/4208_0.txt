Great local ice cream stand with a lot of different menu offerings. I've only had their soft serve though and it's fantastic!  Service is fast and friendly and they take credit cards! Yesss! (I hate carrying cash)\n\nThere's a small parking lot and plenty of covered seating areas to sit and enjoy your frozen treat.  They're a seasonal business...I believe they operate from May - September.  Come check them out while it's still summer in Ohio!
