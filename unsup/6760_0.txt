My entire family went here yesterday to celebrate Father's Day and it was a hit! The pizza was delicious, and we were thrilled that they had a vegan option for our daughter. We also had the pizzeria chop salad that easily served two. Our son had the turkey french dip which was also a favorite. Ended the meal with gelato and affogatos, Definitely will be going back again and again!
