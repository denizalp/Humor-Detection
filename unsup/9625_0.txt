Yum! I always like stopping in here after I grab some chips and salsa from La Mestiza, just down the way. \n\nThe yogurt is so refreshing and light. I'm a fan of the white chocolate, and last time I was in they had a plain tart flavor that was delicious(it would be fantastic with fruit, too!). \n\nService is always friendly.
