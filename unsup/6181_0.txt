LOVE THIS PLACE! It's literally a shack, not much to look at, but don't let that fool you! I love the Mexican food here, it is scrumdidallyumpshious! Prices are cheap and you get a ton of food! My favorite is their Carne Asada Burrito! Stuff full with steak, beans, pico, guacamole.... my tummy is very happy after eating here! I got my food baby on (huge full tummy that makes me look pregnant) then I went back to work and tried to concentrate while in a bliss of food comaness! Great little spot for a quick bite!
