The manager of this place is an absolute idiot! We were in with 6 friends, all of whom are in the bar business, spending money in the bar. He comes up to me an demands that I either turn my shirt inside out or leave because it's a Support Trump shirt. Lol, when my girl and I walk out parked out front are 5 squad cars who responded to the dumbass' 911 call. BTW, the officers all liked my shirt!
