We eat here more then 4-5 times a week, it's our healthy dessert place!\nThe staff is helpful and friendly , always offer samples and the place is clean.\nThe texture of the frozen yogurt is creamy (most of the time)\nGood selection of toppings and yogurt flavors\nAnd we keep on coming back for more!
