The Service: Our server is very sweet. However, hard to track her down. Only 1 server at the bar area. \n\nThe Food: HAPPY HOUR MENU ROCKS!!! $5 for all the food. Very nice presentation. BUT... very very very small portion.\n\nNew England Lobster Roll - GOOD!!! Crispy at the bottom, creamy on the top.\n\nBeef Tartare - weird texture, didn't really like it\n\nKing Crab Louie - soso, taste like devil egg\n\nSeared Scallop - Tasty scallop but wish there is one more piece\n\nValrhona Chocolate Custard - creamy chocolate... yumm!\n\nWhite Chocolate Bread Pudding - THE BEST!
