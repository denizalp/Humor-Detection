It's not the bakery that I go for, even though their Eclairs and Macaroons are the closes thing to heaven! It's the 24 hour availability the delicious sandwiches and coffee drinks and the free wifi. This is a great place to kick back and get some reading done or just people watch. Also, a great place to take visitors. They're impressed overtime.
