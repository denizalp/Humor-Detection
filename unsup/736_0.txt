As luck would have it, I wandered out of the Bellagio just when the Fountains were performing. It certainly stopped me in my tracks and had me enthralled the entire time. The crowds were manageable and that allowed me to watch from both water side and on the upper horseshoe. I loved how the music and the water danced and intertwined, and how happy it made me feel.
