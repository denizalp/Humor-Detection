Worst haircut I have ever had I don't understand how these people are still in business if your old and you want a boring haircut go to V's if your young and you want a nice haircut don't let your foot step in there. They will also get mad at you if you ask them to cut your hair a little shorter after there done 20 bucks 30 dollar tip first time and last time I just hope you people can learn from the mistake that I made.
