As a full time mom I obviously don't have time to work on getting a tan, so I decided to get a spray tan today at Bronzmopolitan. The place is nice and clean, the staff very knowledgeable about their products and extremely helpful. My spray tan came out amazing and I now have that perfect bronzed glow just in time for the weekend. I will definitely be back, and not just for the complimentary cocktail of choice upon visit (awesome concept). It literally looks like I just got back from Jamaica. Loving my spray tan results and this establishment!
