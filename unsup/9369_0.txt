Convenient location but the young ladies working on Saturday 6\/4 left a lot to me desired in terms of customer service.\n\nWent in about 230p to pick up an online order. With no other customers in the store, it still took 15 minutes to pick up my item. This item was a simple Apple Lightning Cable that had been \"ready\" for over 30 minutes. There is no reason the pick up should have taken that long.
