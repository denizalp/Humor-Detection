Dear, Cora Pizza...\n\nI love you and all the yummy goodness you have provided my stomach over the past two years. As a proud 'card' holder, I will continue to offer you my undying loyalty $4 at a time. Your service, food, pricing, and hours of operation are amazing. Thank you for satisfying my daily pizza cravings. \n\nPS: I recommend trying every slice they have to offer.
