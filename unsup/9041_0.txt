This review is for the bar area only. I did not go into the restaurant area but my mom did and was not happy with it. Personally, I enjoyed the 2 for 1 margarita special on Saturdays. Get them on the rocks and not from that slushy machine (unless you want brain freeze). Those slushy ones are usually all sugar. On the rocks, salt on the brim...wowie! Great bargain!
