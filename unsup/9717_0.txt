Fun the first time, somewhat less so if you return.  They played a couple of fight songs, and Garth Brooks' \"Friends in Lowly Places\" or whatever the stupid song is called, every time I've been there.  Can be busy on weekends at night, in which case service is going to be so-so at best and you may be standing the whole time.
