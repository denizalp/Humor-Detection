Wahh! It turns out Lily has \"gone back to school\" permanently and no longer works at Pearl Nails. I was devastated to learn this news. How could the perfect nail esthetician leave me like that!? Anyway, enter My to the rescue.\n\nShe'll now be my go-to girl for a perfect ten. My hand massage was out of this world (fell asleep immediately) and her application was flawless (no cleanup required).
