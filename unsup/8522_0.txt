Pretty interesting vibe in here and the bartenders are really chill. What sucks is the music is cranked to the maximum, even when there isn't many people around. Who is listening to this music and why do they like it so loud? This, I'll never know. Also, they don't serve beer by the pitcher. Balls, I tell you.
