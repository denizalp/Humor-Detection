So much food you'll either have to share one dish or take some home!\nThey have NY style deli sandwiches, and food for all times of the day.\nTheir bagels far outdo Einsteins and they have quite a variety of cream cheese for those. You can either sit down and eat there or pick it up for to go.\nThe food here is amazing and it's always busy because its so damn good. \nMy only complaint is that parking sucks, but it often does at busy\/awesome places.
