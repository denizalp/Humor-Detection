Totally suggested! Every dishes taste authentic and flavorful, plus, the lamb chops are extremely soft and tender, I'd like to come here when I older than 80 and my teeth are all gone but still enjoy this meal! But the way, I'm Chinese, but I love these Italian stewed meal, it's really close to my culture's traditional eating habits. Yummy.
