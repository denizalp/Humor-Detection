Ok, compared to the imperial Buffet this was ten times better. Yes it was a bit  pricey, but the service was fantastic and the food was so good I ended up going back three times. The place was clean and very professional looking, a place that you wouldn't be ashamed of going too. Even the crowd of people that were there seemed of a higher class of people compared to the Imperial.
