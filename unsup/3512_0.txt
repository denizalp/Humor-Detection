Came back here after 5 months but for dinner this time and I have to bump them up 1 star because food was a lot better (still not great but heaps better than lunch last time). \n\nFinally got to try the bone marrow and it was mmm mmm good! You get to sprinkle your own salt on top so you can flavor it to your own liking.\n\nThe macaroons and gelato are still dessert favorites!
