There once was a man from Romados\nWho suffered a chicken overdose\nBut when he recovered \nHe quickly discovered\nA new spot had emerged in his comatose. \n\nMa Poule Mouill√© is a relatively new chicken spot right across from La Banquise. It's brightly lit, has a clean interior, and pumps out some of the best chicken on Rachel East, probably due to the fact that it's run by a former Romado's employee. \n\nPortions are huge and are relatively inexpensive given how much you get. The combination of awesome value and awesome taste gives this place a big 4 stars.
