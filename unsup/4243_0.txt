Friendly, courteous staff.  Appointment actually almost started on time and Dr. Handel was very personable during the examination.  They also have a great selection of stylish frames with many top designers.  My only complaint is that they charge extra for the eye mapping (to avoid the awful dilatation drops).   They took care of all the insurance claims and my frames were delivered within one week.
