Well, lets just say this is a super budget hotel in a ghetto area. Rooms are vintage and budget. Trash wasn't taken out outside and was overflowing everywhere onto the sidewalks around the entire building. Broken glass everywhere on driveways. If you're not familiar with Vegas, well, what can I say, stay away from this area. Had a couple guys come up to me while I was sitting in the car parking lot offering me drugs. Would not go back to this hotel ever again.
