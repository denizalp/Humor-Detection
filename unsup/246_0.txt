I made a delivery order last night to a vape shop.The delivery guy seemed to be so uncomfortable with the ambiance.I asked him if he's okay,and he's like uhm no,I wish they turn on the exhaust here or somewhere.I understand that but dude  its a freaking vape shop.When I gave him cash for the payment,he didn't even bother asking me if I want my change,he just left.That was just rude.
