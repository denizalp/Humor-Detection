Stellar service! Everyone was very personable when I brought in my bike to get serviced. I initially only wanted my wheels trued. I got a call though the next day saying my tires were absolutely shot and probably needed to be replaced. And they were right about that, and now my bike rides about a million times better (I like hyperbole.) \n\nGood communication (in person, by email and by phone!), great customer service, the price was about the same as other bike shops. Would go back.
