This is the worst starbucks ive ever been to, they are ALWAYS OUT OF EVERYTHING!!!!!! And there is usually only one person working at a time so it takes forever..... Ive been in line for literally 20 minutes, this is completely ridiculous! And people who work here usually have a bad attitude like no type of costumer service i swear. Not like other starbucks where they are nice and smiley. They act like they hate their lives . Who can blame them
