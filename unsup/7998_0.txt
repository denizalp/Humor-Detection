Fresh, well prepared and inventive food served in a bright, urban environment. Excellent service by well informed waitress. I chose the delicious shrimp and artichoke lemon risotto and my date had the Yellow fin Tuna salad which was sublime. We started with a fresh Asparagus soup that we shared and an absolutely fantastic chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce.\nVery reasonably priced for the type of food served. Wholeheartedly recommend this gem.
