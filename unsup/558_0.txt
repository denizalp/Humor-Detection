In all honesty it tastes ok. So why did I give it only 3 stars? The answer is simple, first of all the roll was filled with only lobster knuckle. When your paying $15 I expect some tail, also way to much celery. I also tried the shrimp and crab roll. More of the same, a lot of mayo both seafoods were mushed and shredded beyond recognition. For a few dollars more might as well be seated in a nice restaurant downtown and be served the proper way.
