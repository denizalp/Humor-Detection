I love it. From the marble floors that were shipped overseas from a castle in Scotland, to the new-fangled computer labs and drink bar, this place is great. It's a great place to take groups of my students; you'd think they'd be bored, but it's tough to remain disaffected when you're surrounded by all that knowledge!
