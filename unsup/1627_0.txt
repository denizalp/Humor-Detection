Came here for a quick bite to eat while my daughter cheered at The Orleans. Ordered two western bacon cheeseburgers with zucchini. And I must say. This has got to be the worse Carl's I've ever been too. Not only was my food horrible but the service was bad. My zucchinis were still cold and hard. And the burgers were not cooked probably. I couldn't even finish my food comfortably without thinking I'd get food poisoning. Never again!
