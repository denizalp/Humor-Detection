This buffet just sucks. Who advertises all you can eat crab legs and then only serves them cold with no butter. Says they close at 10 then we arrive at 8:30 and were typed they were closing at 9:30 with a line still out the door. Stupid management move. Then to top it off once inside huge line of people waiting for them to bring the food out. Sometimes the cheap comes out expensive.
