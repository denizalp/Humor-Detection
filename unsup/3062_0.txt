If I could give this place zero stars I would. We showed up and when we asked how long of a wait there would be the lady so there's no wait time so we purchased 2 hours. Once we got in we realized you needed a harness for literally everything well we got in line and literally sat in the same spot in line for an hour. They need to have more than just one location to get harnesses from or they should give it to you when you pay. Don't recommend going until they fix this problem
