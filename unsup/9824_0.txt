First of all I just want to warn anyone who even THINKS about eating here: a bad idea... The place was like an oven, hotter than outside. The waitresses didn't even seem to care if you were a customer or not. The food was putrid to the point where I took it back and told them that I refused to consume such filth. Avoid.
