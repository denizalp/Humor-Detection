Crappy experience,  left pissed off after having to argue over stupid bottles of paint that their sign said was on sale but staff says doesn't apply, even though the sign is hanging in front of the whole display of paint.   If it wasn't for my daughter wanting to paint,  we would have just left.   We'll go to the one on power and 60 next time, or maybe Joanns.   We never have issues at that store.
