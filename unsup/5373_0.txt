These cookies are INCREDIBLE, what's the secret? Seriously baked with lots of love or lots of crack. (Joking) because they are just a delight on your tastebuds.\nThe coolest concept is you can order in bulk and freeZe the cookies. When they de-thaw, it's as if they were baked fresh that day. No exaggeration! \nI will definitely pre-order our next family gathering and family holiday party!
