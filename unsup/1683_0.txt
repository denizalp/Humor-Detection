It's a good place to eat, the price is reasonable. I think everyone knows what to expect when they go there.\nI like the atmosphere. Salad bar is consistent, I really like the option of being able to eat healthy., or if you want to slam down a lot of bread and processed meat you can do that to.\nI do think that some people are taking advantage of the free ice cream a little too much.
