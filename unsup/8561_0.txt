I ordered a gorgeous carne asada salad (at least the menu photo was pretty) medium rare. What I got was over done tasteless plate of shredded meat on yellow lettuce. I sent the salad back untouched and lost my taste for anything different. When presented with a bill for full cost of salad I was shocked! My husband paid it but will never go back. Terrible place
