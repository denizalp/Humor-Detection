My brother-in-law needed ammo, and he asked me to pick it up for him. The first time I went in they were sold out, but the guy behind the counter was helpful and told me that he would put my name on a waiting list and call me when the ammo was avail. Next week he called and I was able to pick it up, easy peasy.
