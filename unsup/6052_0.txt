Really good pizza. Really good drinks. You will read more about these in other reviews. \n\nMy issue - the frizzy haired hostess at the entrance who committed the cardinal sin for me upon my arrival. She said \"just one tonight?\"\n\nYes sweetie, just one, you condescending b***h. \n\nI may give this place another chance, but I swear if I am greeted this way again, I will take my money elsewhere.
