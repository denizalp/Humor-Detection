\"What makes me weep so? From time to time. There is nothing saddening here.\"\n\ndearest cheskie, i would give you my heart if i had one, if you sent me to an early death with your confectionery delights my epitaph would just  read 'oh well', i'd want my kin to say at least he didn't die of common sense. \n\ni don't know what the names of any of these things are, so i'll go by shapes..  \n\nget the circle one, the square one, the upright triangle one, the hexagon, and the trapezoid looking one...\n\n then meet me in the alley.
