This place sucks. Family of 5 - three kids in tow - arriving from the U.S. connecting through to Europe. Had to leave the airport and come back through security a second time. Then the restaurant dinner options - holy crap! How awful. Finally found a place where we could sit down - chairs bolted to the floor and no tables for more than 4. Then $85 for sandwiches with no drinks or sides. This place SUCKS!!!!!!
