So I had their chilli chicken kothu last night.... And had a stomachache since. It wasn't only me, but all 4 of my other friends who had the same thing are sick too. TBH it tasted really good, but definitely not worth the food poisoning. So all in all, if you need a doctor's note or you got commitments to dodge the next day, this is your spot.
