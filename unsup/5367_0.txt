Cute cute space that's easy to find!  Loved loved loved the avocado toast (chose it on multi grain).  The breakfast sandwich with bacon on an english muffin was delish!  Not to mention the lavender iced breve...not too sweet, just right.  The staff was friendly from the minute we walked in the door until we left.  Loved the decor (cutest pink telephone on the wall!).  See ya again Cafe Lola!
