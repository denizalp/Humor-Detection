Why schedule an appointment when you get there on time they make you wait for over 30m??  \n\nI HATE Apple.  One guy told me they don't replace one AirPod that I have to buy a whole new unit???  Funny cause Apple Support told me I could.  So know your job. Idiots aimlessly walking around not helping cause it seems only one person can help everyone scheduled for an appointment.  Wish I could leave less than one star.
