This is an excellent location to get away from the grind and bustle of the city. There are many places to hike off the loop, stargaze, meditate or simply relax. I've been coming here for years - grab the annual pass and visit weekly!\n\nCons: It has increased in popularity so sometime you must suffer the ignorant\/rude that cannot drive the loop or simply cannot dispose of their garbage or dog feces in the appropriate receptacle.
