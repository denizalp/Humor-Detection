Friendliest service ever! We come here a lot & love the company. We had a hard time finding a good breakfast place since moving from Cali. And then we were sent here. Sometimes there is a wait, but being in the service industry I understand, shit happens. The food has always been worth it. They also have the yummy french vanilla creamer, not just the non dairy creamer. How can you go wrong with that???
