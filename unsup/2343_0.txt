I was researching tinting companies and came across Omar's on Yelp. All the other places I was looking at were only open M-F so I thought I would have to take a day off work to get tinting done but Omar's is open on Saturday and I was able to book an appointment only 2 days in advance. Omar was great and explained the different options and the job was finished in less than 1.5 hours. The tinting has a lifetime warranty too. High recommend!
