I am staying at the oasis RV park in Las Vegas. Their Internet is terrible.  I would never let LV.net on my property.  \n\nIt's not that their service is completely slow. It's that their login process is difficult across multiple devices. You could never get back to the page for agreeing with their terms and you never know if you're really login or not.\n\nOverall the customer experience is bad.
