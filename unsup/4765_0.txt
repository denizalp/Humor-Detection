The GM called to help resolve the issue of the late registration. She offered to pay for the extension of our registration (which I already paid for,) and to have a 3rd party go to the DMV and obtain our registration (we provide the registration fees of course.) For this, I will add one star for the effort. But the entire finance department is incompetent and the receptionist (she was from Brooklyn,)who handled the calls were terrible.
