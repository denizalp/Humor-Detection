First time here. The mushroom soup was delicious, the salad was very good with cranberries and almonds, the chicken Kiev was absolutely out of this world. My son would have gladly had seconds. I really enjoyed the vegetables with the chicken. The roasted potatoes were a bit dry and the desserts (strawberry rhubarb pie and chocolate fudge pecan caramel cake) were average.....nothing to write home about. Great job with service! Couldn't ask for better. The show was very well done. A wonderful evening all around.
