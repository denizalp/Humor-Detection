I have been picking up a friend that lives close to Bosa. He practically begs me to stop every time we go by. \n\nThis is a great donut house. They love their costumers and I think of it as fortune, to find nice places that offer something good. \n\nYa, every once in a while I crave the sugar coated orbs, lol.
