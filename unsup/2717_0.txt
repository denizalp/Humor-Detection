Not impresswd with this shit hospital and i thought Spring Valley was bad. They see you pretty quickly and then youre stuck waiting hours... when you ask if youre going to be seen the nurse has to be a sarcastic bitch. One ounce of advice you guys dont ever go to ERS in Vegas because theyre all the same... they just give you pain medicine and send you on your way. If i could this hospital would be a negative 5!
