I love this place.  The menu is a twist on regular food, I can't get enough of the buffalo mac and cheese, and the pork shank.  Nice, modern atmosphere, convenient to the downtown cultural district, and reasonably priced. The only thing I wish they had was good bread.  The bread there is baked there, but it's not good.
