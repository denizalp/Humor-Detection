Ordering flowers from Flora Couture could not have been easier. I placed my order in the Yelp app and sent a beautiful 'Desert Blooms' arrangement to my BFF on his birthday.\n\nWhen he sent me a photo of the flowers, the arrangement looked just like the picture they had on their site.\n\nI will definitely order from these folks again!
