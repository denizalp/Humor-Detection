The management does not seek professional services when dealing with maintenance issues to keep operating costs low. This has caused a health issue with flooded carpet and pad in the unit. Totally mishandled. Staff seems to have difficulty keeping you updated on what is going on with maintenance issues.\n\nEvery place has issues I understand but this frequently is a bit rediculous
