The Valley Ho is one of my favorite hotels here. It has a lot of history (going back to the 50's) and a very unique look and feel to it. I was a regular at Trader Vic's before they closed. This was my first experience at ZuZu. I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner over a Moscow Mule and their popular ZuZu burger. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I love the outdoor seating area and the inside modern decor is just as amazing with all the colors and uniqueness it brings.
