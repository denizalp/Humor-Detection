I LOVE burgers. Go on and judge me. \n\nBig Smoke Burger is a great alternative to Hero's. I ordered its Big Blue burger combo with onion ring. It was delicious. You really can't go wrong with gorgonzola and burger - it makes your burger sound AND taste fancy. \n\nI paid under $ 15 for a decent-size (un)healthy meal which is awesome. The ambiance is also better than other burger joints (not even talking about McDonald's). \n\nWill I go back? Definitely! \n\nWill I tell my family (and friends concerned about cholesterol)? Hell no. \n\nCheers to greasy onion ring!
