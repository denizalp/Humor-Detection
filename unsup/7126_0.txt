Birthday dinner celebration!\n\nGreat place for large parties and family style dishes. All the dishes are huge and more than enough for everyone to share. \n\nService was great. There were about 20 of us and our server did a great job at paying attention, refills and making sure we didnt need anything else...\n\nOnly thing I dont like is the menu is on the wall and not to easy to read. We took a picture of the wall so we could go back to our seats abs order. A bit of an inconvenience..\n\nI'd definitely go back!
