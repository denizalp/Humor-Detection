Eh, kind of maybe somewhat overrated. It's great late night drunk food but costs at least $4.50 per slice. Errr.... However, it's in the Cosmo so this doesn't surprise me.\n\nStill, the product is a super greasy slice, not a gourmet pie. If they're going to play the \"hidden gem\" game, keep it cheap and gritty. This is not.
