Just wanted to update my review after the apologetic response I got from Hakkasan management. Though the service the night of was definitely poor, I do hand it to the team for reaching out personally to everyone who complains. I'm a huge customer service girl so that meant a lot to me. Hopefully I'll have the chance to return and the experience will have improved so much that they'll get a couple more stars on top of these two!
