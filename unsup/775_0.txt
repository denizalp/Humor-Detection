Its a three br Condo complete with kitchen and a patio. Poolside has bar and grill restaurant. The food at the restaurant are your traditional bar and grill food.  drawback the tables by the bar had unpleasant odor it would be hard to eat there, So we opted to eat faraway from the bar, morelike at poolside.The house keeper didn't ckean our room, just changed the linens,well as least that was done. Anyway, t his place is ok
