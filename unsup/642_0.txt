Like any top-tier slut, eggslut is fast, casual, discrete, high quality, and hangs out in the right part of town. Sure, it feels and looks a little like an airport restaurant, and you can tell tons of people go in and out in no time, but the goodies are worth sharing. The steak and egg brioche sandwich is not to be missed, and this is one of the easier, cheaper ways to get that afternoon delight.
