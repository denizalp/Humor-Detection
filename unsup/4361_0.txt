Good drinks, sure, but come for the view. Was here a few days ago, can't remember the cocktails but certainly remember the view. Nice atmosphere, great for our date night. Server was super nice and very attentive but not over intrusive. I actually do remember the cocktail, had a Sazerac, it was well done, and true to form. Typical strip prices, not over charging just for the view. If you're looking for a nice date spot and you're already on the strip, you should try it out.
