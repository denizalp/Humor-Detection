I used to meet clients at La Bistrote on a regular basis. The owner was very rude on numerous occasions - making us switch tables to accommodate larger parties when the place was completely empty and most notably for berating my clients for not ordering something during a 5 min meeting. It was absolutely embarrassing! We were planning to come back for lunch a few mins later but after this encounter, I will never go back to La Bistrote again. If you don't care about being decent to your customers, don't open a restaurant.
