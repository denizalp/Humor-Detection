What an awesome spot! They've been making the same great food since I used to go there in college. I had a fantastic salted fried pork, which I always loved and scallion pancakes which aren't even on the menu!!! Try Orient Kitchen if you like Chinese. If you're a first timer, though, you may not appreciate it.
