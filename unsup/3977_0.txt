Rad little bakery, but you're outta luck if you don't call in an order. We got here at about noon-ish and most of the baskets could only boast the crumbs of what I'm sure were delicious loaves of bread. \n\nDetermined to purchase bread regardless, we ended up with a loaf of multigrain, which the friendly bilingual girl behind the counter very kindly sliced for us. We also came at the perfect time to snag a tasty spinach and cheese burek fresh out of the oven. \n\nLove finding cute little spots like this in my side of town.
