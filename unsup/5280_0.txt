I went to this Subway for lunch the other day and realized when I got to the register that I didn't have my debit card in my wallet! I didn't have any cash on me and the cashier was SO nice and understanding and let me take my sandwich and told me to come back and pay the next day.  When I came back we had a good laugh about the whole situation.  Top notch customer service right there! \n\nThey are always friendly and accurate and keep the line moving during the lunch rush.
