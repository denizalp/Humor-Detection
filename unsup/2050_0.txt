Went here for lunch - 2nd visit - and service was efficient and friendly.  We both really enjoyed our meals - I had the salmon, leek pub pie which came with mashed potatoes & peas, large helpings and all delicious!  My husband had the chicken wings with fries and really enjoyed them.  This feels very much like a real British pub - love the ambience and definitely recommend a visit\/meal here.
