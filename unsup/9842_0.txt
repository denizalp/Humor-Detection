Meh, this store is really no big deal. I feel even for Hershey's lovers, it's lackluster. The store is divided into two stories, both of which are pretty small and open, but uninviting. It would be great if the chocolates and candies weren't overpriced, if they offered samples, and if they offered more varieties like international candies and what not. Definitely a tourist trap
