This pains me. We have been to CPH multiple times, they have the best HH in the valley!\n\nHowever, last week during HH after ordering multiple snacks and cocktails, my date ate the oysters and was violently ill later that evening. I didn't eat any oysters and felt fine. I am concerned with how they handle their seafood.
