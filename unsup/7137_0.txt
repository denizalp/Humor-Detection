This is one of my favorite spots to go to in the east valley! I've been coming here since 2013 and it's been great each time. Their smoked wings are on the top of my list of things to order. You won't be disappointed! The beer is always cold and the staff is always friendly! Great atmosphere to watch college and NFL football!
