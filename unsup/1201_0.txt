We were visiting Hoover Dam.  On our way back I checked Yelp for suggestions for lunch. We stopped at Little City Grille. The LA chicken wrap was delicious and filling. My family had crispy chicken wrap protein style, the philly steak, and a chicken salad. My mother who is a picky eater was so surprised at how delicious the food is. If we lived closer this would be our favorite restaurant!!!  Great staff and atmosphere
