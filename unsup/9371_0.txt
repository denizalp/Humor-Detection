I had discovered Wilbur not too long ago on Instagram so I had decided to check it out. Most definitely a choice I did not regret! The food was fresh and served quickly in a very comfortable environment. I ordered the chicken tinga which tasted slightly different from what I am used to but nevertheless delicious. I will most definitely be returning soon!
