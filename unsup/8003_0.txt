Got the pastrami and it was super good! I heard this was a must try and it did not disappoint. Went at 1:00 on a Tuesday and service was quick. It's a good Pittsburgh experience and the sandwich is good and soooo filling! If you are in Pittsburgh I would suggest this for something different from the usual food.
