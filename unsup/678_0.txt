So here I was in this store once again to try and get a different shoe size for my daughter's Running Shoes,,,,,,,,,,And Guess what they didn't have the size BUT another Soft Moc had the size that I was looking for. So l asked the young lady behind the cash register if she could get the shoes in my daughter's shoe size sent over to their location from Vaughan Mills and you will never guess the answer she gave me...............ooh Duh Nope we don't do that.................what the heck what era are we in???
