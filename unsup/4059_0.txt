I've been to Xs, Tryst, Surrender, Marquee and the club inside the Eiffel Tower at Paris and this is the most low quality club I've ever been to in Las Vegas.  To try and make up for the lack luster appearance they spend all their money on DJ's and none of the Decor\n\nGarbage 100%\n\nWant an unforgettable night?\nGo to XS!\n\nWant a club with horrible lighting, small, cramped, and mediocre in every aspect?\nThen this is the place for you!\n\nThis is the circus circus of Las Vegas clubs.
