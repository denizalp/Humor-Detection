Ordered pick up 30 minutes ahead, because I live pretty far away. They told me they would hold off on cooking it so it would be hot when I got there at 7.30. They obviously didnt, when I got to my mom's house (less than 10 minutes from zzeeks) with the pizza,  it was cold.\n\nAlso I ordered a deluxe, and they gave me a grand slam. I'm glad I paid $26 bucks for a cold pizza I didn't order.
