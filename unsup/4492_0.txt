We were here to buy a faucet for my aunt as a bday present. The man in the wheelchair in the plumbing department was rude and condescending. My husband is a plumber and knows what he is talking about and this guy rolled his eyes at us and tried to tell him he was wrong. I don't live here thank goodness. But my aunt does and said he was that way with her too. Maybe he needs an employee evaluation and retraining in customer service. End of rant.
