You cannot access the bathrooms without a code. Why? The bathroom is the only reason I ever go to Starbucks. I also like to use it before I buy stuff as I cannot concentrate on what I want to have before I pee.  This makes ordering here impossible for me. Also I don't like Starbucks coffee it looks like diarrhea.
