I like visiting this location.  They take extra care to make my order just the way I like it.  This visit was during 1\/2 price Frappicino's happy hour.  I wanted the S'mores Frappicino with low fat milk and not too sweet.  My barista made it perfectly! I wished I would have gotten the receipt so I good thank the person who made my drink.
