I hate to do this because the people are really nice here, but the last time I went back in May, there was a cockroach running under the Gelata stand.\n\nTheir pizza is ok. I like that it's fresh, but flavor wise it's very simple. It is quite pricey as well. My small pizza with 5 meats, olives, and onions is $25. \nDon't come for just simple pepperoni.
