We visited tonight for the first time and it was amazing!   We asked for flats only and fried extra crispy and they delivered.  The garlic parm was delish as well as the mango habanero and thai chili.  The guys working were super friendly and helpful.  Coming from upstate NY three years ago, this is first time we have found amazing wings in AZ.  Can't wait to go back!
