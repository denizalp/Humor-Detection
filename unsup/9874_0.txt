My family and I frequent Ohjah Hibachi, so I was excited when I heard they were opening a ramen joint. Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed by the food here. \n\nI ordered the miso ramen and it was not really anything special. The broth was OK, the noodles weren't great. Best thing about this place was the modern decor. \n\nOverall, I felt the ramen was mediocre and this is not the first place I'd go if I was craving ramen. There are many places that have more flavorful ramen in Vegas.
