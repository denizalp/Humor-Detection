Oh how I have missed you Sam's Club. I had forgotten to renew my membership a couple of years back. My employer offered a great incentive so it reminded me to sign up again!\n\nI enjoy everything this store has to offer and then some. Did someone say rotisserie chicken, sushi, cake, pizza, produce, inexpensive gallon milk and wine? Oh yes, just to name a few of their yummy goods!\n\nI am addicted!
