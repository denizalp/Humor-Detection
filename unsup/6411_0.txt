Didn't have a chance to eat. Super fancy hostesses must not have noticed the 10 open dining spots on the patio or the 6 open tables inside. We managed to get seated, drinks and food by the time our table was ready at thirsty lion. It's one of my biggest pet peeves... to see a whole bunch of open tables and have to wait. When we left the other establishment we visited, there were still a great deal of open seats outside... \n\nNo thanks. I'm good.
