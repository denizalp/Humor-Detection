Everyone was getting spicy chicken according to the reviews so I thought I'd try it. Not really spicy at all, I find mongolian beef is spicier. Expected more flavor and a bigger menu. Great service though. Very kind people. Did wait a bit for food but it came out fresh so that only makes sense. Overall I would recommend this place to others in the area.
