Had work done to my 05 RSX-S. Dent on my rear quarter panel, rear bumper, and cracked tail light. They did a really good job. They detailed the car inside and out. Brandon, the Sales Rep, is friendly and helpful. Only complaint would be that it took so long. Couldn't stand driving a slow rental for over 2 weeks. I sent it in on Nov 13 and got it back Nov 27. Was it worth the wait? Sure. They really take pride in what they do and it shows.
