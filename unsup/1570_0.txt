WORST MCDONALDS EVER!!!\n\nI spent $7.11 on the Habenero Ranch Quarter Pounder.  I asked for the burger to be made fresh at the drive thru and asked for ketchup.  Pulled up and waited 5 minutes and was greeted by a burger patty that was so overcooked it was like biting into a piece of jerky.  I also received cold fries, no napkins and no ketchup.  Does this place have any quality control??  Took my money to the immensely better Burger King across the highway.
