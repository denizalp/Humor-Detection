The first time I wanted to check out this club I looked at the crowd and they were all ghetto!!! So we left. The second time.. The bouncer was on a power trip and expected us to pay cover PLUS tip! We were 4 females! What club charges for 4 girls to go in?! They have really bad customer service! I'm not even going to try a third time here. Not worth it. And pleeeeease notice the date on all the positive comments for this club! They happened in 2009! It's so not like this anymore!
