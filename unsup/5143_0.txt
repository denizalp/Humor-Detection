This place is better than let's say...Circus Circus, but falls short compared to almost everywhere else on the strip. The seafood buffet is worth the visit alone, but it seems like your gambling bucks would be better spent at any of the other wonderful locations on the strip. This place seems a little darker and slightly more sad than the rest. There was a guy shooting heroin in the bathroom offering fellatio for money.
