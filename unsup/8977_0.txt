Ah, Vegas....\n\nI was actually visiting a buddy of mine who lives in Henderson after a rough night on the strip (nearly got arrested due to mistaken identity????????...irrelevant).\n\nAnyways...I was in a somewhat sour mood the next day and coincidentally, super hungry, so my friend suggested that I try this place out.\n\nTo keep it short, everything was great.  The food, the drinks, the price, and the service were all..well...definitely brought me back to a cheerful state of mind.   Thanks, Fukuda.\n\nTry it out.
