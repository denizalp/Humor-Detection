Tega Cay Gourmet Deli is located in Tega Cay, SC (near the Walmart Supercenter).  My manager (from work) has been raving about their breakfast rolls.  \n\nI ordered Ham, Egg, and Cheese on a roll (with an extra egg).  YUM!!  Exactly as my manager mentioned, the rolls were delicious!  It did remind me of the breakfast sandwiches \/ rolls that my significant other and I used to get in New York City!  \n\nENJOY!!
