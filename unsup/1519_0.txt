i think the arizona science center is pretty cool.\n\ni've only been here a few times...and unless something really really cool is going on..i will not make it a point to come back often. but it's cool factor is high enough to give it 4 stars instead of just give it 3.\n\n\nthis place is seriously allot better with a beer in your hand. trust me.
