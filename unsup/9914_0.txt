I recently had work done to my Volvo S40. Replaced rear bumper, one tail light and refined a quarter panel.  They did a great job!!  Neelam was my service rep, understanding how worried I was when I dropped my car off there, she quickly doodled a heart with chalk on my car indicating she would take good care of it, which she actually did. I am a picky person about details. After all, my car looks brand new and am very happy with the outcome.  I would recommend 427 to anyone without any hesitation.
