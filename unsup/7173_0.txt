Thick, solid, juicy, tight. I'm getting way too excited. What was I talking about? Oh right, the burgers. Very good. I really liked the onion rings here, too. Service seemed indifferent, but whatever the burger was good. My only beef with it is it was too bunny (get it? beef!). I want my hamburger buns to get out of the way. It's only purpose should be to hold the patty and toppings together, nothing more. Too much bun absorbs the flavour, and that's what I find to be the case here.
