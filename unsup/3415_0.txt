2nd Swing is great and the staff is extremely helpful and courteous. I brought in 3 wedges whose grips were probably worth more than the entire club at this point. I was offered a few bucks more, per wedge, than I was expecting. After finding a perfect replacement to complete my new set, I walked out having spent less money and less time than I figured I would. Russell was extremely helpful and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. I will certainly be a repeat customer now.
