Love it!  Food is great... expensive, but you know what they corner the market, because after you eat one you will want another one and another one and what spot (other than the grocery store) do you know where you can get a good hotdog. Its worth it though.  I got the Italian sausage with mustard and onions, delicious, Enjoy.
