Comfortable and modern. My son and I stumbled upon this McDonald's when we were driving around and got a little peckish. The decor was clean and spacious, and it had a nice cafe feel to it. Service was pleasant, and we enjoyed a couple of spicy McChicken sandwiches, fries and a McCafe drink. We enjoyed our little visit.
