Had jerk and curry chicken. Wasnt too impressed. I'm not Jamaican but been to Jamaica, and eaten from street vendors there, plus had Jamaican food in NY, DC and all over the US. Just not spicy and tasty enough and its more expensive too. Portions are smaller. I've been to the other jamaican spot in town and the quantity was bigger and jerk chicken more tastier. I'll still try them out later just because not that many options in vegas and I love me some Caribbean food. \nAlso $3 for a bottle of Ting is a bit too high!
