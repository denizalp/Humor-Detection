Horrible.  I did not like this place at all.  It appears that they just want to showcase how hot they can get their food.  Even the regular salsa (which at most places I tolerate) like liking the gates of hell.  I'm currently pregnant and sensitive to spicy foods right now but this was was absurd.  I ordered the chicken tacos and it seemed like the meat was simply covered in black pepper and that was it.  We will not be returning.
