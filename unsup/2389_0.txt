Found this restaurant while driving from Cleveland to Cincinnati.  Stopped for lunch.  Great selection of sandwiches and salads.  I was impressed that they had diet pepsi, diet coke and diet dr. pepper.  Awesome burgers!  House specialty cheesesteak wasn't bad too.  Prices were very reasonable and service was great!  \n\nThey won numerous awards.
