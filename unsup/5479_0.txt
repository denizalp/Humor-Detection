I would give this review a zero if I could. I was playing mini golf with my boyfriend, having a very nice time. And then we are on hole 9, and we hit the ball, and then next we look and coming out of the hole was A RAT. Did you see that? A RAT. We left immediately. Never will I ever go there again.
