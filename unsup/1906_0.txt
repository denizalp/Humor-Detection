Stopped for Sunday am breakfast- one spinach pastry which was tasty but light on spinach.\none steak & egg breakfast - roast beef is not steak!Dry toast served without butter or jelly. By the time we got butter the toast was cold & butter came from refrigerator.  Got Neapolitan  to go- it wasn't fresh. Eggs served at least 5 min before spinach pie which just had to be reheated. \nMight try again for lunch but wasn't impressed w breakfast.
