This was right next door to our B&B.  Until yesterday there was a wooden terrasse outside w\/ tables and a wooden sidewalk extending into the street.  Yesterday it was dismantled for the season, but until yesterday it was a busy social scene.  We sat outside a couple of days ago and I had a glass of Shiraz while Alan had a beer.  The waiter was friendly and good humored.  Alan's beer was too bitter for him.  My wine was fine.  It was a nice place to hang out for a while.
