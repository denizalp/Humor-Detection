Its says that you have to be in by 8pm so you can be done by close time at 9pm.\nI arrived at 7:55pm. As i was walking up, the lady in there signaled that they were closed. I said its 7:55pm, she pointed at her clock on the wall and said we go by that clock. I said your clock says 7:55 too! \nThink she just didnt want me to wash there. \nI had one load and it was the cover to a bed.
