This place is now on my Vegas must-do list forever!  The Hall of Fame is nothing fancy, just rows and rows of pinball!  I was even more stoked to reach the last row and find air hockey, and OG versions of Mario and Tetris.  And on top of all the awesomeness, I was able to get my Mike & Ikes craving on!  If you're looking for a fun Vegas experience with 100% less saline boobs and drunk douchebags, this is the place.
