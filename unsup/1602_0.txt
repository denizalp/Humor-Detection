I've wanted to eat here for a long time. It's unique with the nautical decor but the good leaves much to be desired. I ordered the perch sandwich. As in other reviews the pan co breading is too much for a delicate fish. Could not taste anything but the breading and the onion in the tarter sauce. Brennan's across the street was busier which generally means it's the preferred place. If you do decide to eat at Bills, take a wheelbarrow to the bank first to pay for dinner. It's OVER priced.
