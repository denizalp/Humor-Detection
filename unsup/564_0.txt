Finally! A place with gluten free blueberry pancakes. my 2nd all time favorite food :) I've been here like 5 times in the past two weeks and its so good. The side of fruit is amazing too. grapefruit slices, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and sliced melon! \nFresh squeezed orange juice is the cherry on top to an amazing meal. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. My new favorite breakfast spot :)
