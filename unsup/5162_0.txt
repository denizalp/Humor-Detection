Delicious tacos, lots of variety to choose from! They also have a salsa bar with a ton of different salsas to pick from. We got a glass of Sangria and it was huge but delicious. It's a small hole in the wall type place, kinda sketchy area. Parking available in the back. Would def recommend this place to anyone. Will be back for sure!!!
