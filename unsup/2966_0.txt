Spicy beef noodle soup!!!\n\nThey serve dim sum, but we came solely for the soup after a long night of fist pumping. Service isn't too warm and friendly, but they're prompt. The beef noodle soup comes out piping hot, and the broth has just the perfect amount of spice. The chunks of beef are soft and exude flavor, and the noodles are great. LOVED it!! It's also perfect for hangovers... just saying. Definitely want to make this one of our stops on our many Vegas excursions.
