Battistas's Hole in the Wall (Vegas). Nice ambiance (reminded me of Italian experience); sweet old (90's) man with accordian tried to play it!  Funny and accepted a couple bucks for 30 seconds of attempted playing. It was fun, nonetheless.  Great service, FANTASTIC food!  One of the VERY best Italian food restaurants we've visited in 36 years.
