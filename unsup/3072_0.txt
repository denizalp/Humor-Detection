Went with 2 friends after work. Like the atmosphere. Hostess and server were friendly and patient. Menu is large and varied. Tomato bisque was tasty although not much of a bisque. More like thin soup with chunks of onions and tomato. No crackers with soup. Brought bread when asked about this. Charged $1.50. My friend loved her risotto--not drowning in cheese. Drinks are expensive. Rum and coke $6. Crowding and cold temperature contributed to less than comfortable dining. Would not bring kids here--too expensive and few simple menu choices. Cheese curds for appetizer are $9.
