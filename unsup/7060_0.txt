On a Saturday morning, I had a breakfast crepe: Marco Polo for $7.50\n\n- Very cheesy. Italian sausage and cheese wrapped around a crepe\n- Comes with your choice of cottage cheese or chopped bananas\n- Play off of Great Expectations?\n- Order and eat like Panera. \n- If you're not WHITE, you'll be a token outlier! Seriously. LOL. LuAnne S. & Chad M called em out! haha\n- Love the live camera showing how the chef is making the crepe!\n- Busy. Tell a bud to grab a seat while you order.
