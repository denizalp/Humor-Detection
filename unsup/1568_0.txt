Delicious food, poor service\n\nI came for lunch, and this place was packed!! I ordered lunch special #1- chicken red curry, which was delicious! The curry was great, lots of flavour, the mango salad was awesome and tangy and the spring roll was great. \n\nHowever, the service was horrible. There were 4 ppl in our group but they brought out the food for 3 while the 4th had to wait about 20 mins before their food came out. If you are not in a rush, this is a great place to eat, otherwise be warned.
