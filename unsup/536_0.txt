Had a great experience buying a car from this dealership. After walking in Arnold Lim was there to greet and help me. I found the lounge and showroom are very nice to be while waiting during the car buying process. I did find Arnold a bit pushy, but at the end of the day he was helpful in answering questions and patient when I asked for time to think.\n\nI would recommend Mercedes Benz of Gilbert if they have a car that interests you.
