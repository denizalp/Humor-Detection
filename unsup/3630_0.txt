Love this very special restaurant. The spicy vegetable and chicken soup is extraordinary. Both the salads and sandwiches are excellent. Don't miss trying my favorite ginger house dressing. The owner is very friendly and the food is delicious. A regular favorite of our family who is tired of the same unhealthy options elsewhere.
