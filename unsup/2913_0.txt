I've visited sugar factory at town square a few times now and each experience has been excellent. The food is always delicious and beautifully presented, the service impeccable, and the atmosphere is always so fun! I especially give a big thumbs up to my favorite yummy drink, the gummy bear goblet. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or local :) perfect for a girls night or date night!
