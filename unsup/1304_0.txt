I like Maizie's.  It's low key and has good food.  I went on a day where the burgers were some outrageously low price (I tried to order some more to go, only to find out it would be regular price).  That burger was really good and on great artisan bread.  I also tasted my friend's fresh basil marinara which was excellent.  It had mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives, spinach, and other good stuff on fettucini with marinara sauce.   I can't wait to go back and try some more.
