I love this gym! You get the feeling (and attention) of personal training in a room of 20 or so people working out. Everyone who works here or works out along side you here is encouraging, motivating, and friendly! Max and Stephanie create a warm, welcoming environment and the staff are so helpful!  And the coaches are knowledgeable and attentive.
