Best sandwich ever! It was $10.50 or so for just the sandwich and a small ice tea though.\n\nOkay, i have to tell you, I got the caprese sandwich. I have not tried the other items on the menu. So I changed my star rating to 3 and after I have sampled a few more things i will let you guys know. \n\nDon't want to be misleading!
