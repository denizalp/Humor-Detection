I live in Vegas and came here to visit. This store like all the other Zia's has a great selection but I will never return to this area of town. It feels like you are about to get stabbed or mugged when you pull up or step outside. Clearly this used to be a CVS or Walgreens at one time. They need to move to a better spot.
