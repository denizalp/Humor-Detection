Road Trip\nSummer 2016\n\nI'm really disappointed I didn't get to see any shows in Vegas this year. Since this was our last destination on our roadtrip, we were either too tired or too lazy to make any definite plans. But, hey, at least I got to see a couple circus acts with my toddler!  \n\nLIKES:\nFree!\nEntertaining!\nFamily friendly!\n\nDISLIKES:\nSeats fill up quickly.\nA douche bag can block your view if you stand on the side to watch.\nSchedule of shows is hard to find. (I wish it was on the Circus Circus Channel or somewhere in the hotel room.)
