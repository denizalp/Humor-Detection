This place is the worst.\n\nI went around ten on Saturday night and it was packed.  It seems the place is intended to cater to rapey, Nickelback-loving, popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them.  \n\nThere is no place to sit, no place to talk (because it is LOUD) and zero ambience.  To its credit, though, I was served quickly (because there were like 3000 bartenders) and it wasn't that expensive, but it would take much, much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again.
