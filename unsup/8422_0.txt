This is THE best overall restaurant in Madison, on par with many fantastic places in New York, Chicago, Miami, etc. in terms of food, cocktails, and overall ambience (and certainly leaps and bounds above most Madison establishments).\n\nIt blows my mind that people rate places like The Old Fashioned with the same amount of stars. The Old Fashioned and its equivalents (Great Dane, Brocach, etc.) are trash compared to this place.
