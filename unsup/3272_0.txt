A new opening and we're already regulars. Delicious food, great service and a good price.  All you can ask for.\nThe chicken tikka masala is the best I've had, rich, savoury taste and wonderfully tender chicken.  Shahi Paneer is a great combination of sweet and heat. We've not had anything here that was not above expectations.\nArrive hungry and expect the best!
