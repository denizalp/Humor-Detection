Geico Presents: Tiny House - The Restaurant!\n\nYes, this place is absurdly small, but the food is still great. It used to be my go-to Yours Truly, but now I fear I'm just too big to enjoy it on a regular basis.\n\nAs with the other locations, you can't go wrong with Notso Fries, burgers, chili, breakfast, or the Fryday Fish Fry special.\n\nI would recommend going during off-peak hours to attempt to avoid the crowds. This restaurant feels cramped when empty, but it's a sardine can when it's full.\n\nDid I mention this place is small?
