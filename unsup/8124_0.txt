I tried this place out for lunch last weekend. The food was fantastic and very inexpensive. $6.00 for lunch! My teenage daughter is a very picky eater and she said her bacon cheeseburger was the best she'd ever had. Staff are very friendly. Good atmosphere and vibe. All profits are being used to feed hungry kids - so that's very cool. Check it out if your in the area. You won't believe what $6.00 will buy you!
