Like others have said, keep in mind its a chain.   I had a great experience at the Flemings in Oklahoma City that I was dying to try out Flemings in Madison.  However, I was somewhat disappointed.  I had the fillet with garlic mashed potatoes and my steak was cooked too much and the mashed potatoes were too garlicky.  I also felt I was being isolated since I was having dinner by myself.  I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris over this location.
