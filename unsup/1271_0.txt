The service and food here is absolute garbage. Came here in the afternoon for a late lunch and ordered the following: \n- Smoked deviled eggs \n- Smoked Salmon Ni√ßoise salad\n- Fried calamari\n- Octopus salad \n- Mushroom soup\n\nAll of these dishes were horrible. Also, do the chefs even taste what they make? Everything was overly salty -- to the point where I was chugging 5 glasses of water just to finish a bite. Our server was no better, she never smiled and was quite condescending. \n\nIt's sad because the interior is gorgeous, but everything else here is shit.
