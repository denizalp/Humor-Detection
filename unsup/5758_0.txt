We came to do shopping today in the evening I went to take item from the shelf and it shows a different price than ring up on the register and the customer service manager accuse me of change the price.\nShe gave me bad attitude and made faces in front of people.\nI don't recommend to buy there at all!!!!!!!!!!!!
