Very friendly teachers and staff, but definitely not the place for us.  I didn't realize until our tour that the Waldorf method advocates no books, but all copying off the chalkboard, no black crayons or colored pencils, no reading until age seven or eight because \"the children's souls aren't developed enough\", the same teacher from first to eighth grade to act as the children's spiritual guide and a slew of other peculiar rules.  I realize this may appeal to many, but it certainly didn't fit our needs or beliefs.
