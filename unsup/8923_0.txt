Had the Wings (extra crispy , all drums) requested the sauce on the side. Mix up in the order but not a big deal.\nWings were as advertised, very good\nGarlic fries were good, but couldn't tell the difference between them and the regular fries( yes I had both, I was on my fat boy) \nDon't judge me. \nOverall pretty good, wouldn't go back, the ambience wasn't for me, however the staff was great.
