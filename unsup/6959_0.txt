It's a shop that mainly sells vintage clothing. They reworked it lately, and arranged all sections. Noting that in the past you could find anything anywhere and couldn't move easily through aisles, and floors; it looked like an attic; it was packed with miscellaneous objects. \nEach time I go there I notice that something changed, it is like a living place! It's always a new discovery!\nThere is a coffeeshop, food, books and several small cozy corners and terraces to enjoy your moment!
