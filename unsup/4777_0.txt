The Montreal staple for pies. My favourite slices are the bananalicious, Mille feuille and rock a brownie. I have yet to try the key lime which looks very tempting. For around 20$ you can get a full pie which works out great for birthdays or other parties and will feed 6-8 people. All in all you can't go wrong with this place.
