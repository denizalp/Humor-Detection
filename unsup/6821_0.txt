Bri was the consummate professional. She arrived early and was ready to work the minute she got there. I signed up for a make up lesson and I didn't think it was possible to learn so much in a two hour session. She taught me not only about technique but also about proper skincare and the importance of having the right tools. When I got home I told friends and family that it was probably some of the best money I've ever spent in my life - I wish I'd gotten a professional make up lesson 20 years ago.
