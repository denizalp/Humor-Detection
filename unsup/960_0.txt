Good food cooked perfectly, with A+ service. This is a pre fixe menu with a few choices for two or more courses. The menu changes every couple weeks, so it's always a different experience when you come for dinner.\n\nRichard took great care of us, this is the second time we've been fortunate enough to have him serve us. I couldn't ask for better service, better timing between courses, or ambiance. The patio is gorgeous. \n\nThis is one of my favorite fancy places in Scottsdale to eat. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Great date place.
