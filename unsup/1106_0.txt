*****Great breakfast spot on Mill!! :) \nI had one of their hot sandwiches the FOCACCIA ROMA-CHICKEN, cut up grilled chicken breast pieces, tomato, gooey melted provolone cheese, light mayo on a cheesy Focaccia bread with added minced jalapenos and lettuce to mine!!  It was delicious!! I also ordered my favorite drink the Caramel Macchiato, but instead they mistakenly made me a caramel latte which was still as good as a Caramel Macchiato. Overall, the service was great and so was my sandwich and drink!!\n    *I will surely be back!! :)
