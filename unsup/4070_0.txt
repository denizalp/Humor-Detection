This is the only place we can get our fix for Maryland style blue crabs.  We always order large females with extra oldbay seasoning and we take it to go. The staff is ok and the place is a bit small.  I tried their Ahi salad and was not too happy with it. The only other things we didn't like is when we call to put our order in they are already out of large females and its pricey.  The only reason we come here is because this is the only place that serves blue crabs Maryland style.
