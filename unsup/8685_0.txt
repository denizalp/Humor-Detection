OMFG\n\nJust had my first massage.  There were times when the pressure was a bit much for my fragile self but I'm writing this review in a current state of trance that is AHHmazing.\n\nMy body was incredibly sore this morning from a recent hike and this was exactly what I needed! \n\nNow I'm off to go lay around listening to Above & Beyond and enjoy another state of trance\n\n#ASOT\n\n*OM*
