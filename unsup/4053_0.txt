The Best Pizza place in Las Vegas! On top of that, this family owned business from NY treats you like family. Everything they make is top notch and fresh. Best pizza I ever had anywhere and I am from the East Coast. So stop in and see Tony, John and the rest of the family, you will be glad you did.
