I'm a grad student at Pitt and I work in the cathedral as well. Waiting 15-20 minutes or walking 5 floors down to still wait 10 minutes for an elevator is SUPER annoying! Lunch time is the absolute worst time to try and catch a elevator! \n\nI read comments about how beautiful and amazing the cathedral is and I just don't see it. I traveled to several different countries and I lived in a number of places in the US... I'm sorry but a tall building in freaking PITTSBURGH lol is not impressive.
