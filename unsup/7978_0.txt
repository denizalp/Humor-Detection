Just waited in line for 15 mins for a coffee while the two women behind the counter sauntered around as if no one was even in line! Unbelievably slow service and we finally walked out. Get it in gear!  Worst service I have ever experienced and I won't be back.  15 mins of my life I'll never get back.
