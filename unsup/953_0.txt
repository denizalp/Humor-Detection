I saw a few \"staff problem\" comments.  We had a bad staff experience as well.  Very average public course and grouchy, unprofessional staff.  It's pretty clear that they have some serious problems with the way this course is operated.  Spanish Trail's best days are far behind them.  We will go elsewhere to play golf in the future.
