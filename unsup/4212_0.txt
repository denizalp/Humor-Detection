Our best meal in Phoenix. Started with some Green Chile Sliders which were hot and spicy (just like my wife). The I had the Carne Adovada (which was awesome) and my wife and her mother had a trifecta of enchiladas. Everything was fantastic. The place is a little divey with an eclectic and fun crowd. Looking forward to breakfast next time we're in town.
