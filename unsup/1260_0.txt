It's too bad this place has such a low rating because it doesn't deserve it.\n\nI agree the decor or aesthetic atmosphere is lacking, but the food here is outstanding. I highly recommend the beef and lamb...and I generally hate lamb!\n\nThe portions (at least for the meat dishes) are quite large; two people could easily share a dish and get stuffed.
