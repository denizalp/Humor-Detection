Absolutely amazing!!! We love the food here.  The sushi is fresh. I can't say enough about how great the service was.  Our favorites were the Jessica albacore, garlic was yellow tail and tuna carpaccio. The AYCE was well worth it!! For dessert we have the tempura ice cream and tempura cheese cake. I could live off the cheesecake. If you are looking for a good sushi spot, this is the only place I would recommended.  Steve and Kris ware AWESOME!!! They made great recommendations and made the meal entertaining and delicious
