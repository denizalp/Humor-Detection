My parents and I came here for dinner last night. Our dull evening turned into an escape into the past. We literally lost track of time in this beautifully crafted restaurant with an old world charm of the 1960's. \nCheck out this boutique restaurant for it's unique menu inclusive of craft cocktails and fusion desserts. I licked my plate clean.
