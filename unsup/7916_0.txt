Do NOT buy this mattress. I called to return after 60 days and they told me that I would have to pay $400 + to return it. I decided to keep it, and now, just 4 months later we have big holes in our bed from where we normally sleep. Talk about a $1,000 + mistake. Horrible. Not comfortable for side sleepers, might be for back sleepers, but NO NO NO. I think that the company must scour its online reviews to remove the negative comments because when I searched, I found nothing bad about them. That's deceptive.
