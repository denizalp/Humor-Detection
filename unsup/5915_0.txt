Not a bad buffet, it's a great value for $20, which includes a really good prime rib on Saturday night.  It's soft and tender and way better than the one at Wicked Spoon which will cost you about double.\n\nUnfortunately, the other items are so-so and nothing noteworthy. Skip the lobster tail add-on, it's not worth it.  We got that because both of my friends are Emerald status and got a gigantic credit to pay for this.
