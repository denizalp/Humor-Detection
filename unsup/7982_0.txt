Excellent food! Outstanding service by the entire staff, our server\/Bartender was Max. \nWe came in on a Sunday for the Happy hour and the oysters were incredible!! We had 2 dozen oysters, the tuna tartare, and the Bao sliders. Everything was incredible! \nSadly i am worried this place will become too popular for me to visit but i had to give them the 5 star review!
