I recently just moved to Ohio and I LOVE WALLY WORLD!!!! This Walmart is an embarrassment to Walmarts world wide. The clothes are all over the floor and barely any staff to be found if you have a question. They are rude. I don't understand, this place should've shut down for 2 months and fire all employees and start all over.   Glad I \"Yelp\"! I have to find a Walmart I'm comfortable in soon.
