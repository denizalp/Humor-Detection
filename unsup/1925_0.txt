Don't EVER order pho from here.\n\nMissing so many ingredients from what I've ordered when I specifically asked for sliced onions and cilantro with pho but not only that, its missing basil, jalapeno, lime wedge, hoisin sauce, sariracha sauce too. Noodles were packed so compacted I can't even break it apart in a boiling hot soup.\n\nI'm telling my university friends to never order from here. My dog wouldn't even eat it.
