This doctor is the best as far as I'm concerned.  \nShe did a routine physical and found a possibility of cancer.  She sent me to another fine doctor who verified her findings, operated and I am free of cancer.  I was previously to another doctor here in Las Vegas who found no indication of cancer.  \nShe is personable, sympathetic and not hard to look at either.  She also helped me get off the booze.
