Do not take kids here!!!The owner told my son that he was not allowed to touch any of the toys. What a crazy policy to have...how can I decide if he likes a toy or not if he can't look at at\n\nItems are overpriced...$40 for a Thomas storage bench that was in poor condition\n\nWorst part of all...there is a GIANT dog in the store, the biggest dog I have ever seen! A dog in the store....really...gross\n\nWill not be back.
