I can't say it enough, I love this store! I'm here almost every week. The people are so friendly and helpful. They've been so nice and have really gone the extra mile to be sure I'm happy. I would recommend this store to anyone from the novice (like me) to the expert. They know their stuff, they have healthy livestock and they take very good care of their customers. I'm lucky enough to live close by, but if I didn't, I'd still come here. Beautiful display tanks too!
