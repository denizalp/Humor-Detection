No customer service here.  Was late for the plane with 20 minutes to go and a carry on bag and they would not let me on.  Next flight was two days later. I know it was my fault but they were not helpful at all.  Had to buy a new ticket out of Phoenix to get to Sioux Falls.    On the return trip back to Mesa, it took them AN HOUR to get the bags from the plane to baggage claim.  For me, a lower price is not worth lack of service.
