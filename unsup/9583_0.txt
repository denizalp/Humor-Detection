I really wanted to like these cupcakes, I was so excited when I got them but they didn't live up to the expectations. The icing was good and flavorful but the cake itself was too dry and sweet for my palate. I ate them the next day after purchasing them and didn't refrigerate them as I was instructed by the staff. The cupcakes look enticing, just don't taste great. For $2.75 or $3.75\/ cupcake depending on what you get, it was a complete disappointment.
