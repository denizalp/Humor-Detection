Great place to go for family horseback rides. I  really liked the set up and the ease with which they do paperwork, riding prep etc. They desert in north Scottsdale is beautiful this time aof year and the grounds are lovely for a spring ride. The staff was very helpful , courteous and knowledgeable.  I would go there again in a heart beat.
