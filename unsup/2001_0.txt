We had high hopes for this place. From the moment we sat down it was bad. We ordered two pizzas and some appetizers. \nWaitress said it takes about 40 mins for pizza to be ready. We ended up waiting\n an hour and twenty minutes. We were the only customers in place. I have never heard of a pizza taking that long. Cold maraina sauce was thrown on top of pizza which cooled off the pizza. There were two kids running in and out of the place. I can say we definitely will never go back to this place.
