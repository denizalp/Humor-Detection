Hands down, best chicken fingers ever.\n\nSeriously...these are not your average chicken fingers with processed meat and fake flavors. These are real chicken breasts fried, and they taste just like fried chicken.\n\nThis place doesn't offer much else - you can gets meals that come with coleslaw, french fries and texas toast...but for me, the chicken was the star. I didn't eat the rest of the sides.\n\nOh yes, they have sweet tea. And very clean bathrooms.
