I just had a trailer hitch installed by Scott and I am so happy with the quality job he did. I brought in my own wiring harness from the manufacture and he took the time to install it into the bumper requiring him to drill a hole in it. The result is an install that looks better than OEM. He also switched the parts around so I got a small refund. Couldn't be happier.
