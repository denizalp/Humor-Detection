I absolutely love the Village Buffet! The food is always delicious and the service is amazing! They have a variety of selections to choose from even if you're not a huge seafood lover! My favorite dish are the lobster tails..they are so good. The price is not bad considering what you're getting. They have oysters, crab legs, shrimp, crawfish, and tons more!!! Definitely worth checking out!
