Absolutely amazing!!  Took my wife and my mother to this show at the Palazzo.  It started a bit slow; however, it picked up steam as the show progressed.\n\nOf the 4, I thought the guy who was \"Guadio\" was the best singer.  The Frankie Valli singer was not too shabby at all.  Great character development over the course of the shows.  \n\nOf course, great songs like \"Walk like a Man\", \"Oh What a Night\", and \"Can't Take my Eyes off of you\".\n\nHighly recommend this show and we will return for an encore!
