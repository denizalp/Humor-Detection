Walked in on a Monday afternoon was seated at the bar.  Wasn't sure what I wanted due to all the different choices.  Our bartender Kala made a few great recommendations and let us sample a few options.   I went wt a strawberry mango Margarita and finished off wt a blueberry pomegranate Margarita.  Both were amazing but the blueberry one was THE BEST.   Thank you Kala for your recommendations and fun conversation.
