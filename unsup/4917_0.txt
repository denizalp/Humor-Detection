Crust was great! We tried the garlic chicken and ceasar salad. Got a great deal on groupon, $20 ea for 2 visits for $18! We'll come back even if we didn't have the 2nd visit. Love the crust! Salad, I can pass. Only had croutons, Parmesan and light dressing. \nCustomer service was good and friendly, especially on a Sunday 7pm!
