Baring in mind this is a bar in the airport I was INCREDIBLY impressed! I asked for a sandwich and off handedly mentioned we were sharing it. It was brought out on two separate plates already cut... most restaurants won't do that!!! I watched a waitress chase down a customer to make sure he didn't forget the full water bottle he left on the table. Plus the selection of local beers is awesome!! Sooooo impressed
