** they have moved to a more central location from Indian Trail\n\nWe came here from out of town and its not the kind of location you just stumble upon.  So I was pretty surprised that one of the two sales people never even gave us a hello, much less inquired about what we might want.  Selection while we were here was sparse with very little in the way of smaller pieces or accessories.  Left kind of disappointed after planning to come here for a long time.
