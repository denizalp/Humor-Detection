Really fresh Lebanese cuisine at a bargain of a price.  I got the Flavor Savor Special which consisted of grilled Chicken Mishwi and Beef Kafta on a bed of seasoned white rice with vermicelli, served with mixed greens, alongside Hummus and Falafel.  It was a ton of high-quality food at a great price. \n\nTheir menu also clearly designates which items are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free or contain nuts.
