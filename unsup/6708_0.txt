Warm and inviting atmosphere, excellent food, the best service we've had at a Madison restaurant (and we've lived here for 35 years). Prices as expected for the superb quality of the entire experience. On a personal note, it was our anniversary which I noted while making the reservation.  My sister-in-law & brother brought a dozen roses; the folks at Heritage found a vase and allowed us to keep the flowers on the table during dinner. Our menu had a \"Happy Anniversary\" banner, and the staff offered their good wishes when we arrived and left. Highly recommended restaurant.
