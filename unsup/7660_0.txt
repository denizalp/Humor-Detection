I thought it was terrible. From the highschool basketball team masquerading as fine dining waiters (a tux does not make the service right!) to the fact that everyone gave me a blank stare when I asked if they had pasture raised beef. I cannot recommend this place - it only survives because it's old and the clientele is too.
