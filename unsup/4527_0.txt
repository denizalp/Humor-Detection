I never leave reviews, but this is a worthy exception.  I found myself traveling for work in Scottsdale.  This spot was an oasis in terms of the food, staff, and ambiance\/decor.  Simple menu, but everything was done perfectly (breakfast of champions: avocado toast, fresh oj, and cappuccino).  All of the staff were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and genuinely really friendly. I went back twice during my stay and would have gone every day if time allowed.  Really wish I could take this place back home with me.
