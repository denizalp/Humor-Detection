While the Carlton isn't the fanciest or the most luxurious movie theater around, what they lack in style they certainly make up in value and quality. I mean, movies are $5 on Tuesdays! How awesome is that? They feature a decent mix of big studio movies and independents, plus the people that work there have always been super friendly. Plus, the crisp air conditioning makes the Carlton Cinemas a nice place to spend a hot summer afternoon.
