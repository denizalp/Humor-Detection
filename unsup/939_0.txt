I have given Chipotle 3 chances now and I am done. The food has so much salt and that is all I can taste! I also have never had food over luke warm here. I really don't like it when my food isn't nice and hot. This place is just not for me sadly. The restaurants are always clean and the people are nice but I just can't get over the taste like someone dropped a salt shaker in my food!
