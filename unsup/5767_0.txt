Absolutely sucks. Tons of people at 7:30pm on a Tuesday. Employees are clueless. So many dudebros walking around here, not nearly enough equipment, cramped dirty workout areas. Thought about switching from my current gym but there's no way if it's like this for triple what I pay elsewhere where I rarely have to wait and there's plenty of equipment.
