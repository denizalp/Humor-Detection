A healthy and light alternative to the sauced chicken vendors and the pizza joint here in the South Park food court. Salad with four toppings was decent and filling and I left thinking that I had made a good choice.\n\nOne thing about this food court is the scenery. Lots of people very well dressed (or not well dressed, depending on how you look at it) and way too many teenagers primped for their friends. Was I ever like that? Don't answer that question.
