Owner is legend in his own mind adored by Church St denizens so starved by the lack of even passable coffee anywhere nearby that they think his aggressively average, over roasted swill is actually outstanding. Owner is loving with his regulars and cold, rude and unwelcoming to those who aren't his chosen pets. You people need to leave downtown and head to a place like Lit Espresso on Roncy or better yet take a trip to Phil and Sebastian in Calgary or Transcend in Edmonton to see what quality and good service are in a modern coffeehouse.
