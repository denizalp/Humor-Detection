Just had the 87 burger with sidewinder fries. So good!  Jenny and Geneva are being very attentive, and a pleasure to talk to while I'm watching the game at the bar. This place has good energy. Jacob is a great guy behind the bar, and along with the entire staff, making me feel welcome. This is a must try. I recommend it highly.
