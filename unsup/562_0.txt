A lot of fun! Great for team building or birthdays for adults and children. We did Captains Quarters and it was listed as an easy\/medium room and we escaped with 6 minutes to spare. Some of the clues do require you to use your brain and think and utilize teamwork. If you go with a group of 6-10, definitely get the Groupon deal as it is more cost effective per person. I would definitely come back and try another room.
