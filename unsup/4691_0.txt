This place has excellent customer service. Friendly staff that are happy to answer all my questions and from what I've seen being in the store they sell a good variety of firearms.\n\n\nWhat I really like is the range of accessories. Some gun stores only carry very little and some have a huge selection although it's rare, but this store does! \n\nThanks guys :)
