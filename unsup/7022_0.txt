Everything was great. We had the woo combo (all beef). The service was excellent. Andy was great and everyone else helping was excellent also. They checked on us enough and answered all of our questions since it was our first time. Everyone was very friendly. The food was delicious. The meats, salad, soup, and side dishes were all hot and tasty. Must try! You will not be disappointed. I also liked the fact that everything was clean.
