Not really a big fan of coffee bean but I love the location of this particular coffee shop. This is located across UNLV, and a great palce to chill and hold meetings..\n\nThere is also an open mic session where you can jam out in the private rooms.\n\nI usually order the chai latte at Coffee Bean, not really a big fan but at least it's still a drink.\n\nThey offer wifi and the staff is friendly at this location.\n\nOverall love the spot not really a big fan of their coffee..
