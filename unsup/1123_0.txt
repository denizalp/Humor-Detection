Deuce, tell your waitresses if they won't acknowledge your female patrons then your female patrons won't return.  We arrived to a semi-empty lounge at 1am and seated ourselves in the middle of the lounge.  We waited and waited...20 minutes passed with zero services from the waitresses who were all over the other predominantly male tables.  We decided to leave rather than beg for service.  No thanks.  Never again.
