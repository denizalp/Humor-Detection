Authentic sushi in a swanky spot right across from a sake distillery. Good selection of fish, well-priced lunch specials. I recommend getting some sushi and pairing it up with Blanche De Chambly, which they have on draft. It really accentuates the smoky savoury flavour of the soy sauce. \n\nHad a chirashi along with some a la carte -- the aburi saba is a winner as well. If I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely go again and try more of their stuff!
