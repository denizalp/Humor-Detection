Wicked buffet selections!\n\nI was all over the seafood and meat delights!  Per say, the loads of shrimps and endless slices of prime rib!  Then, came the crab legs, but that took a bit of effort on digging.  Then, off to the lamb meat and other savory treats!\n\nTo quench the thirst, I drank some homely bone marrow soup.  Do drink cups of lemon tea to quicken the metabolism and to make room for more munching!\n\nService and decor went hand to hand!\n\nBottoms up and eat up!
