Yes, everybody knows this place if you are Yelper...\nBeen here a couple of times and the service is always top notch.\nI always get lost coming here as this place is located in business complex and the store is kind of hidden.\nI love to eat their Quiche in the morning. I love their fresh salad for lunch. Everything here is so delicious fresh!!\nWorth coming here just to get their Thai tea frappe. It's sooo refreshing!!
