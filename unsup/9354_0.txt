Me and my boyfriend traveled to Vegas for the first time last summer. Whatever city we are in we love to check out the local flavors (places the locals go, not the places deemed safe for tourist.)\n\n I can't quite remember how we found out about this spot bout we loved and and went there 3 times during the same vacation. \n\nThe catfish fingers are 2 snaps up in a circle!\nThe other patrons we met were cool.\nDrinks were a decent price.\nThere was live music (maybe not every night).\nAnd we still got to play our slots!
