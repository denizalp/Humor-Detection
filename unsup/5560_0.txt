Tucked away inside Eaton Center, Richtree Market offers a food court of sorts, similar to Marche. \n\nTried the Lime Leaf Chicken with jasmine rice at Happy Bowl with a friend. Was not impressed by the bland flavor or the unseasoned, under-cooked vegetables. The chicken breast was moist, which made the meal less disappointing. \n\nThe price is steep for a food court quality meal. I don't think I will be returning to Happy Bowl, but may try the salad bar or the bakery section.  \n\n2.5 stars.
