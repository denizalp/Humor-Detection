Holy crap this place is unbelievable. I don't really know how to avoid repeating cliches about the shock of eating sushi this good in the middle of the Sonoran desert. But that sums it up. Yasu is some freakazoid eccentric genius of a Japanese chef who for whatever reason decided to set up shop in a nondescript area of Phoenix, Arizona. I don't know how to explain it, and I've concluded that there are no answers so as long as he's here I may as well enjoy it.
