I was excited to see this place open up near my house. Overall, it was a decent experience. It's tiny and crammed inside and they only gave two people rolling the ice cream so it took about 20 minutes to receive our order and that was with maybe 4 orders before ours. The ice cream itself was average. I'm afraid nothing to rave about.
