I was visiting my parents and my daughter became very sick.  A friend of mine recommended the office.  I was so grateful when they fit me in even though my daughter was a new patient.  Dr. Wilcock was very informative and kind.  The staff was friendly and I was very impressed.  I've been a PA for two years and have had very few interactions with health-care professionals that were this wonderful!
