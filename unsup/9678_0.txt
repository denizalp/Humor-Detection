OMG!!!! Finally some really really good Chinese food!!! Being from California, middle California, it was difficult to find Chinese food that didn't taste like sh.... Thankfully, this place has stepped up!!! They are new, and I really really hope they don't change. It looks like they are still decorating a bit, with an empty fish tank...but you know what, my fianc√©e and I would probably walk over broken glass to get to this place again!!!!!
