Welcomed with a hug, and left with a bag of delicious food; 2 fish tacos, 1 carne asada taco, and bean and cheese burro (free, kids eat free here). I am Amazed how consistent the service and quality of food is here. Kelly was kind and even gifted us two cups of iced water as we waited. \n\nLooking forward to another visit soon. \n\nThank you Gallo Blanco Familia!
