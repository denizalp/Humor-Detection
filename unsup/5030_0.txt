4.5 stars for super rich and delicious ramen!\n\nI LOVE fatty, rich broth - this was so good but actually a little overwhelming even for my standards. If I were to return, I would get the shio or soy broth instead.\n\nCan't wait to come back.\np.s. lines not too terrible on weekdays off-peak lunch hours.
