Been here a few times. Every time is the same, horrible service. Cashier acted like she didn't want to be there and got my order wrong. Got all the way home to find out the fries and burger I ordered was wrong. Pretty frustrating when you spend about 12 dollars for a meal (without a drink) and it's not even the correct order. I would have been better off going to McDonald's across the street if I wanted my order wrong, horrible service and mediocre food (but at least it would be cheaper). Never going back.
