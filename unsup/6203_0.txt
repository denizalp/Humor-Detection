Super entertaining!!! \n\nSure there was some music that I could have done without, but overall the show was awesome!!!\n\nOur tickets were about $80 for the 2nd level. There's not really a bad seat in the house at Monte Carlo.\n\nIt appears that there are more dancers than the original Jabba, but doesn't discount the show. Actually it enhanced the show. Our party was definitely getting into the the music and dancing and when Jabba started dancing to a snippet of NKOTB - o, it was soooo on!!! The girls went off!!!\n\nPure entertainment and highly recommend checking them out!!!\n\nSD represent!!!
