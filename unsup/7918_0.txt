My $1 install ended up costing $100 because the tech crossed wires and blew up the transmission. Wouldn't shift out of first gear. Puled the stereo and saw where they had to bypass the power and rig it. Not sure how they can say it wasn't them since they pointed out the check engine light came on as they were pulling it out of the bay.  I guess it was an unfortunate coincidence. ....
