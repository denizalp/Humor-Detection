Came here for a cards against humanity tournament with friends. The place was packed for a hockey night. They had drink specials going on until 7 pm- draft beers and house wine (5 oz) for 6$. I ordered the chicken wings (1\/2 portion) with fries and a veggie platter= definition of bar food.\nI had a good time though- seating was ideal for game night!
