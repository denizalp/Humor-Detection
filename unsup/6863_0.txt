So today I was in a bit of a hurry for a quick turn around request for a shirt needed asap. And i was asking around and it seemed I was not going to complete my request but after I called Kat at Creative Mate Design she said she would quickly give me a sample view of my order and my request would be completed in a short amount of time if I liked it.  Honestly I am one happy customer today. I really do appreciate the help and great service provided.
