Another reason I am not a fan of this HOA.   Based on my own observations they seem to pick and choose how to dole out violations.  As a resident, I'm wondering how I was cited for a landscape violation - - which in my view was not even a violation in the first place - -  yet almost four months later I drive by a neighbor daily that still has the exact same violation present in their yard.
