I'm still loving their unique flavors (Such as this week's blood orange tart), the fact that they are open late, and their dog friendly atmosphere. Service has always been great. The owner(?)\/manager(?) was kind enough to give my 2 dogs some samples of their Milkbone doggie yogurt (Dogurt?) which they enjoyed a lot! Upgrade 1 star!
