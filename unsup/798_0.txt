A. Conveniently located, i.e., once you've drank enough floaters at Studio 54, you can walk to this spot\nB. Patrons are scary, i.e., bikers, gang-bangers, doped-up homeless dudes\nC. Food was made quickly, lots of yelling by Jose and Hector on the deep fryers\nD. Burger was like stacked and greasy as hell...the visuals of the girls biting into them while grease was dripping down the side of their mouths was stupendous\nE. This place was dirty as hell (it was 4 am so I'm not mad at 'em)\n\nI will hit again.
