Interiors are okay, and the concept is great. However, the some of the food was really bad and I meant smelt bad. Some of the sushi tasted okay, but I ended up getting food poisoning and called Toronto health. I paid $30 for a buffet and spent the next 24 hours of my life being sick in the bathroom? I expected high standards and quality of food from this place. Never coming back here again.
