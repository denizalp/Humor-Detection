It's been over a year since my last Brow Lady review, so it's time for an update...\n\nLaura is still the Queen of making me look clean and pretty!  She is sweet as ever and still affordable too.\n\nCall today if you need a touch up - I lucked out and found out that this week is a special - brow and lip combo for just $26!\n\nNow that I'm living just a few minutes from The Brow Lady, I'll be seeing Laura regularly to keep my brows looking good!
