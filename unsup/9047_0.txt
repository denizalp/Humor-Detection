I love el pollo loco. I dont mind waiting 5\/10 mins for food that's cooked in an open kitchen. People complain that the food takes awhile but if you've ever been inside during a rush, all the workers are doing something, no one stands around, they all work. \n\nThe chickens always cooked right, great seasonings and they offer healthier options on the menu, more than your typical fast food joint.\n\nThey also have a pretty good \"value\" menu\n\nOver all this place is good. I've never had a problem with the service or the food.
