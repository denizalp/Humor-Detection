My fiancee and I brought my daughter to Amy's for her 13th birthday upon her request.  We ordered the artichoke and jalape√±o dip with the flat bread and it was absolutely AMAZING. We also had pizza and dessert and everything was great.  Amy even came out to wish my daughter a happy birthday.  Don't believe the negative hype,  the food is good!  I think it is really unfortunate that people are bashing them just because of the show, this is their livelihood!  I thought Sammy and Amy were very nice people and the food was very good.
