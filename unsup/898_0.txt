I used to be a huge fan....but they have become a PITA.  From the HUGE rips in their booth to the overcharging for guacamole on their tacos, to the 2oz cups they give you for water, to the attitude they give you for wanting fresh, not overcooked, sitting around meat...they are no longer a viable eatery for me in Henderson.  Go get customers that don't care, I'm sure there are a lot of them.
