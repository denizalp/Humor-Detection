Me love me some REI. I feel like I'm in outdoor equipment heaven. REI, you complete me. \n\nThis company has it all and they carry some great quality stuff. It's a bit pricey, but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. When you're out doing what you love to do, you don't want cheat equipment to fail you. \n\nThe staff here is soo amazing. They're the Gandhi of all things outdoors. Trust in them. \n\nThis place rocks. *drops mic*
