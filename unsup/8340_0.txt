Was excited to try as I had heard how great it was.  We didn't order bbq which looked really good and was really expensive.  We ordered stews and dolsot bibimbap and it was ok.  Portions were small and was irritated when we asked for side dish replacements they told us it would take awhile and didn't replace.  Poor attitudes from our waiter.
