Awesome sushi. Had lunch. Went in at noon as soon as it opened. Really nice waitress. Had the Prince of Persia, Cardinal Roll, salmon tataki and hamachi carpaccio. Freshest fish. Was shocked only one other table in there. Some really creative rolls but only so much we could eat for lunch! Drinks were iced green tea and Bad Panda IPA. Recommend both!
