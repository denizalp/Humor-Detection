After a light dinner elsewhere, I opted to dig into the cheeseburger here at Burgundy Lion. Great service at the bar, and while there's a full selection of spirits, the choices in beers are limited to macros only. It was a great pour of Murphy's, but I really can get Murphy's just about anywhere.\n\nIt's a little loud and the place does get rather busy and that's all great. Neat pub vibe and with TV's tuned to sports, a constant amount of cheering going on.\n\nInside and street seating too.
