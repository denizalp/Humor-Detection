I was so surprised that this was rated so high because my experience was pretty poor.   I went here for dinner specifically because the Yelp ratings were high. Quite honestly it was one of the worst sushi rolls restaurants that I've ever been to and is a one star restaurant.  Service was average and food was poor.  I don't usually review anything on Yelp but this was a very disappointing experience.
