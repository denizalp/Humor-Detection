The go-to burger joint in Downtown Willoughby!  \n\nB-N-B is always hopping; a great place for lunch or a casual dinner.  The juicy burgers are served on tasty Texas toast, fries come in ginormous helpings, and you can't beat Mimi's famous ribs.  Service is fast and polite and on weekends a convenient valet service is offered at the door.  Burgers has a nice selection of beer and awesome happy hour deals.  \n\nAnd trust me, nothing compares to B-N-B Chicken Tortilla Soup on a crisp fall afternoon.
