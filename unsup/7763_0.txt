Flew into Vegas last weekend and didn't get into my hotel room until late. I was famished and not wanting to walk around searching for food at 11pm, so I searched online and found Sicili's. I ordered online, got a call shortly after, met the delivery guy in my hotel lobby, and was eating delicious food before I knew it! Got the pizza with garlic butter, tomatoes, red onions, chicken, and white sauce along with a ceasar's salad. Everything was really good, even as leftovers the next day!!
