Nice big store, lots of selection.  Surprising to see some good deals, mostly in the back on the right side for men's stuff.  Probably the best selection of Diesel I've seen other than the Diesel store in Shanghai, which was 2 entire floors and its even more amazing sections of accessories, but I digress.\n\nCustomer service--or lack of it?  Wasn't even a busy store, and you could've come back and forth without the staff saying hi to you.\n\nA circular room for the shoes.\n\nSeems those oversized watches still in fashion.
