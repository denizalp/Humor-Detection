Three stars is about right. There's a lot of potential here (great space, wonderful setting, decent menu). It's not quite fully realized yet due to some service issues (sluggish but friendly servers and a somewhat surly hostess on our visit) and food missteps (rubbery calamari). This place is still pretty good, and well worth a visit thanks to the strength of its location. I hope it improves so the whole experience matches the atmosphere.
