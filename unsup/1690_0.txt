Walk a mile in my shoes and you'll end up at the The Strip District ! (^.^)\/~~~\n\nIt's no secret....the Strip might be the best thing about Pittsburgh....A lively produce market by day....a busy club scene at night...a visit the strip is not to be missed during my stay here in Pittsburgh ...been here multiple times! And loved every moment of it...its a A short walk from downtown as well ! this area never gets dull! enjoyyyy
