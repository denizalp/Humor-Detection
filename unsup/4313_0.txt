GROSS!!!! Rehab is the only place in Vegas in which you will never, EVER wait in a bathroom line....huh..wonder why..could all the drunk people be peeing in the pool???? Bet they are! \n\nBeautiful pool and great idea but don't imagine going unless you are near black out and get there early unless you want to hide your stuff in a bush with about 200 other peoples items. \n\nPlaying poker in the pool pretty bad ass tho! and bars EVERYWHERE!
