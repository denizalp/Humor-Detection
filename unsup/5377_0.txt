There is a waitress\/cook named Janet ... She's amazing!  Great to talk to is very attentive to your needs and boy can she cook!  Great little place where you can relax with a small town feel.  When I stop in and she's not there I don't stay.. She really is worth the trip and she's worth a 20% tip!! Best waitress EVER! \n Guess that's why she was Miss Commerce of Lake County last year.
