I always passed by Paquime when I was working in this area. I finally stopped one afternoon for lunch.\n\nThat display of Mexican pastries caught my eyes before even hitting the counter to order my food. I had the Pastor tacos. It was filling and flavorful. You can watch them grill in the open kitchen. It took them a bit to prepare the tacos. If you are in a real rush, skip here. I'm not sure if they still offer to Yelper but if you write a review you get either 1-scoop ice cream or 1 free medium drink.
