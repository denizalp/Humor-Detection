Went here to accompany my friend so I just got a basic manicure. The lady really went at my cuticles and it was very painful and I started bleeding. It was even more painful when she applied alcohol to them and tried to get my nails to stop bleeding by putting nail glue on them. I'm giving it 3 stars because my friend's nails were done well, I think it was just my nail tech, Jenny, who was bad.
