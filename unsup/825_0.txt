The Precision Hyundai group are a great relaxed group of people who strive to make the customer feel comfortable and relaxed. I just purchased a new 12 Elantra; and they took me through the whole process very thoroghly and yet relaxed. Everyone is friendly and yet still knowlageable. From the day I entered there ; I knew the shopping experience would be comfortable and non-presured. I ended up purchasing the car; and it might have been one of the best decisions I ever made. Now my wife is looking to trade up as well. Happy Trails!!!
