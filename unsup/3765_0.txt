Went here on Christmas and the wait was long. The waiter we had and was rude and he was HORRIBLE. Our food came very late and my brothers food came pretty late. I had ribs and it was ok and my dad asked for wet towelettes that you use to clean your hands with after you eat something messy. The waiter we had gave us DIRTY WET TOWELS.\nThis was on CHRISTMAS. NEVER GO HERE ON CHRISTMAS. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE EVER AGAIN. I recommend not coming here ever.
