This is the right place for a big date.  The restaurant has a wide open feel an provides a beautiful view night or day. The ambiance is stellar.  The waiter does not stand there and watch you eat, but I did feel like a high roller.  Dress up, grab the love of your life (and a credit card), and have a spectacular night out.
