I cannot FUCKING BELIEVE I didn't visit here the last time I was in town.  Sweet Jesus, I love the O.  And I've never even had one of their famous hotdogs.  No, I'm all about those fries, and the pizza too.  But now I just want to eat it all.  Every last one.  I want to grow a huge ass that is composed of nothing but O fries and cheese.  I guess that's one dream that won't come true.  Sob, sob.
