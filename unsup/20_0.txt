The nicest part of Scarborough quite frankly. \n\nI suspect that the police station and large amount of security guards are responsible for that one.\n\nGo to one of the bars in the parking lot \n\nGo see a movie \n\nGo get your hair cut (provided you were not overdoing it at the bar)\n\nGo to the spa and wax your harry back\n\nGo buy just about anything there.\n\nIf it had any more it would be creepy like the Edmonton mall.
