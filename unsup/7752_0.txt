I've only been to this location twice, the first time there was only one person in front of me but it took half of my lunch break to get my order. A lady decided to get half her office coffee and then add $ to all of their Starbucks cards. Really? Just let me order, then you can do that! \nThe second time I ordered a Carmel Ribbon Crunch Frapp. I have no clue what they made for me but it didn't taste anything like what I ordered.\nI won't go back to this location.
