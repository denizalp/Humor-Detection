Wow. Best food in the valley and served by the best bartenders anywhere.  I would use the term bar food but am reluctant because it is better then most casual dining restaurants in the valley.  Always feel welcomed.  The wings and beef are never frozen and the wings are the best I have ever had. Tons of TV's to watch your favorite team. Highly recommend.
