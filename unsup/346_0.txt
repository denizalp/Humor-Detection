Wow! First time in tonight and blown away.. And I have high expectations as I manage a small business in the food industry. Very clean and welcoming. Tony greeted us and remembered our names and genuinely welcomed us. Everything is homemade and you can tell! We tried the lasagna and the chicken parm. Delicious!! Yes it was $30 but I'd much rather spend $30 here than some unoriginal dish from Olive Garden.
