The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back.
