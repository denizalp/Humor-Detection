Forget about driving all the way to Chinatown for Korean food, come here if you live around the Henderson area! This little restaurant has great Korean food from Bibimbap, to bulgogi and they even serve Japanese food like sushi and katsu curry. I had the chicken katsu which was very good. My wife had the bibimbap. We also split a gyoza appetizer. The food was made fresh and the staff were all very attentive and friendly. Check this place out!
