Nice place!\n\nTry the dirty chai (chai latte made with espresso).  Not only is it delicious, the barista will give you that cute leaf design on top.  The cheese croissant isn't bad either. Plus, Dan Brown's Angels and Demons is on a shelf high enough to prevent anyone from reading it.  That itself gives it 4 stars in my  books.
