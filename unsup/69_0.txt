I unfortunately based on today's food have to downgrade to 3 stars. \n\nThey chopped spaghetti into 1 inch long. It's not spaghetti anymore. No respectful Italians would serve spaghetti like that, even in food court. \n\nThe amount of food they give you per serving also decreased. It's definitely not as filling as when I wrote first review. \n\nIt's still a healthier choice at eat at the mall, I'd probably still come to eat here, just not as enthusiastically as before.\n\nAlas all good things come to an end.
