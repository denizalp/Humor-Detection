Had the shortrib ravioli. Fresh pasta and magnificent beef broth. Wife ordered pizza - was also very good - spicy chicken and she added goat cheese. We really enjoyed it. The menu here is similar to many of his other restaurants in Vegas, except for Spago. I find the food consistent and tasy, and priced fairly.  Setting is really cool if you sit on the patio.\n\nI would definitely return, and this has encouraged me to try Spago the next time I'm in Vegas.
