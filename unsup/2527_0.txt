The employees are rude. I wanted to get some piercings done and I got major attitude from them. I have had piercings done before and I never had to pay for the jewelry separate. For the basic jewerly cost $64 and up. So for two simple piercings it would cost me over $130. I didn't even want fancy or decorative jewelry just the basic. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
