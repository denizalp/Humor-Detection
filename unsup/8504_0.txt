I absolutely love this place. I am always greeted with a smile when I walk in and the service and the staff is amazing. I always get my nails done by Tony and he is by far the best nail technician I have found. I always like making appointments before I come in but appointments are not necessary and you will be taken care of very quickly. The best part about this salon is that they are open pretty late at night so in case if you want to go at 8 PM you can go to this place
