Very positive experience. The staff are lovely, and as a previous guest put it, they are friendly without being overly chatty. I got a regular manicure ($15), and it was great. Definitely good value. I had picked out a gold-y color, and the lady doing my nails suggested that it might be too transparent. She ran over to the nail color wall and picked out an option to go underneath, and it ended up looking awesome! The manicure took longer than expected but was worth the time. Will go again!
