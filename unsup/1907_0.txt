Good, bold, heavy food, go big or go home! Try the BBQ nachos, they come in a bottomless bucket! Tried the poutine which was awesome, cheese fingers in between fries, absolutely great! The menu is pretty well put together and they stick to it, they don't mix and match, Large bar area, great service, strong drinks. Inside the Linq hotel, near the Promenade, near the High Roller. The only inconvenience are the restrooms, but I guess that works for them. The food here might be your only meal you need that day, but again, this is Vegas, anything goes!
