Champagne Fridays. Free champagne for the ladies. I thought it was only one complimentary glass, but nope. As much as we wanted until midnight. Gotta love that.\n\nThe club was surprisingly spacious. Not as big as the other ones, but it being 2 floors definitely helped with the overcrowdedness. Dance floor on the bottom. With random bursts of chilled smoke blasting from the ceiling. Fun!!\n\nDresscode is upscale, but not sure how strictly they enforce that since there were guys in tshirts and girls in tanktops. Definitely sign up for the guestlist if you plan to party here!
