Finally Montreal gets its \"hidden\" bar - it's nothing new as they've done that in London, NYC, Berlin x 20...but still you get 'wow'ed by it (Like a James bond movie, it's nothing new but you still like each new one). \nThe cocktails are so smooth and tasty - be aware, it's quite strong (hense it's great value!). Overall, I'm going to abandon the Lab at this point and go for le mal neccessaire + le 4e mur! :) Ps: it's possible to have bigger crowd up to 10 friends there confortably, unlike big in japan (another 'hidden bar').
