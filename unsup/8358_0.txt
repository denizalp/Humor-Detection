Hollywood Cone definitely has an important place in today's world. Over the top, instagrammable mutant shakes have been all the rage for a while, and they definitely do it well. Do you need a donut on your ice cream? Do you enjoy a banana split that weighs more than your dog? Hollywood Cone is for you.\n\nI popped in with an adult and a toddler for some of their simpler treats and they were delicious. Dipped cones and a rootbeer float. Pricy, yes, but very yummy. Stay weird, Toronto.
