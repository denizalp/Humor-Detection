This really is a nice hotel.  Top-notch service, beautiful, luxurious rooms (or suites, technically), and lots of great amenities.  I really felt comfortable staying here for 4 nights.  \n\nBUT... (here comes the reason for the 5-1 star rating)\n\nWhat's with charging the guest $15\/night for the wifi and gym access??  Come on now.  It's a widely-accepted standard for hotels (esp. those \"nice\" ones) to offer free wi-fi and fitness center access.  Oh yeah, I might also add that their unidentifiable perfume\/air freshner in the entire premises is nose-numbing and migraine-inducing.  Bleh.
