So I've bn going to S&K for my past three inspections because the others were five minutes or less in waiting. But, this time he charged me $40! I paid in cash as always. The receipt was already in the car and it says on the bottom:  \"Total Inspection Fee $6.25 (min) - $30.00 (max)\"\n\nI gave him two stars because, again, it was quick but he lost his five star rating because he charged me $10 over the maximum. Sadly, he also lost my continued business.
