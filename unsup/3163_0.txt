Yummy egg sandwich! I had Fairfax sandwich and I can confess that my sandwich was the most amazing egg sandwich that I ever had. Biroche bun toasted perfectly and scrambled egg was so soft and creamy! I literally chewed each bite twice as much as I normally chew so I could enjoy the extreme delicious taste and aroma of spices. \n\nI wish the portion of sandwich was a little bit bigger so I could have enjoyed more of it.
