I had a lovely experience here. I went with my brother and sister in law on a Saturday night; we all had a wonderful time. The atmosphere is very relaxed and intimate. Our server was David and he was very attentive and gave us wonderful recommendations regarding our menu choices. I highly recommend ordering the tuna tataki and the salted caramel budino. I cannot wait to come back and try their Sunday Brunch.
