After discovering evidence of a roof leak we wanted to be tested for mold. Syntech came to our house the same day we called.\nWe recieved our results quickly.  JT took the samples in our home.  He could not have been more polite and professional and knowledgeable.  We would recommend sytech to anyone. \nPrice was also very competetive. Possibly the best. \nTom G
