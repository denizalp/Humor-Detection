It seems like the pizza is good, but it was no longer hot by the time it was delivered, so I probably wouldn't order from here again. It's kind of a bummer when the food is good, but it has improper packaging and handling so doesn't arrive at its best. The driver took it straight out of the thermal sleeve and handed it to me, but the thermal bag wasn't good enough to keep it hot on a fifteen minute drive. Maybe it left the restaurant cold.
