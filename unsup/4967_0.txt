We spoke to the waitress and she told us everything was made from scratch. It was!  Very impressed with the food and decor. Very cool place and very friendly. The open kitchen was nice. Get to see the action. Drinks are nice but the wine selection was even nicer! Would recommend this spot to anybody wanting good Italian food.
