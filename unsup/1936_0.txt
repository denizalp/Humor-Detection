Today is their 2nd anniversary, any one item is 50% off. I decided to give it a try due to the discount. I ordered the cheese tart since their cheesecake looks like their competitor's. The cheese tart looks more unique. I was disappointed upon first bite. Perhaps I had such high expectation since they are quite popular. I wouldn't order it again. It is a flaky crust with melted cream cheese in the middle. Not my cup of tea.
