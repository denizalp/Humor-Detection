Great way to get up and down the strip without walking. Kinda slow compared to its cousinthe SDX, but this provides a fabulous way to see Vegas for the first time. 3 day pass for $20. Best deal for a short term stay. If you go to the terminal at the North or South end of the Strip there are discounted fares for longer stays.
