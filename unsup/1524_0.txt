The coffee fairies were on my side today! Needed coffee today, I used the magic power of yelp to locate the nearest place & found an awesome hidden local shop! I'd driven by it dozens of times, didn't know it was there. That's the power of yelp! I had a caramel latte, yum! Great price, hopping shop but plenty of indoor & outdoor seating! I'll definitely go back, now that yelp has showed me the way!\nAnd now I see that my Yelper friends have been there as well, definitely a hot spot!
