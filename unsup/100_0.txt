This is my favorite steakhouse of all steakhouses I've tried thus far. The service is always excellent and the steak...MMM. I always get filet mignon, no matter what steakhouse I go to and boy does this place deliver. Oh, don't forget to try the chocolate cake. Their chocolate cake comes out warm, served with ice cream, and filled with chocolatey goodness. It literally melts in your mouth. It is SOOO GOOD!
