Awesome spot! Grand Opening night and seems to be doing great! I'm not surprised, owned by an honorable man; whom hired respectable people! The food is always phenomenal! The environment is very relaxed and subtle but still has a sweet energetic vibe too! SWEET PLACE! Leo and I are very excited to add another amazing place to grab late night food and drinks along with Herbs & Rye!
