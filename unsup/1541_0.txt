Finally updated the waiting room furniture. Really hope the exam rooms are next. Things are falling apart in there and is severely outdated. The efficiency in the front desk seems to be getting better. Wait times vary, but usually not bad. However, the wait time while sitting in the exam room waiting for the doctor is long. The no cell phones in the exam rooms is a crock of you know what. Everyone passes time with the cell phone. Especially with the long exam room wait period. I can see things improving for the future.
