Screamery \n\nNew Ice Cream place on Tatum and Shea that makes it's own ice cream. Was told it is from Tucson.\n\nNice cow theme with black and white walls and benches inside.\n\nPeppermint Chip is a fresh and tasty flavor which I would highly recommend. Also tried the Strawberry Sorbet which was ok, they are very willing to allow you to sample as many flavors as you want.\n\nWill come back to try other flavors
