Nice people but food is not good. Everything was over cooked. We tried the pork katsu, fried chicken with Korean sweet soy sauce, poke, kalbi, chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, pork chops, and more...over cooked and dry!!! We were really looking forward to this place too. Unfortunately they did not meet our expectations. Sorry.
