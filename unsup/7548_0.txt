Never had Tibetan food before this and gotta say I liked it but my husband didn't care for it so much.  His beef soup was over cooked and had a scorched taste.  A little out of the way from tourist Toronto.  We live in Buffalo and love exploring the wonderful restaurants of Toronto.  The flavours were good but it was executed poorly.  Everything was overcooked.\n\nIf I had to explain the flavor I'd say it was Chinese meets Indian flavors. I'd go there again but not sure my husband agrees.
