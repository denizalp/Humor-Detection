Okay. So I cannot stress again how picky my two little ones are. I decided to do takeout family style. SCORE!! Kids are stuffed. They could not get enough of the chicken parm with angel hair. Salads, bread. Some soup and several dishes. Feels like Christmas if I were Italian and could actually cook !! Thank you for filling our bellies again. Man o man. If you haven't found this wonderful restaraunt yet, I feel sorry for you. The new favorite for us grown kids....chicken riggies spicy number three ( I still think I could handle four) lol.
