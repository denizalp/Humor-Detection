We ordered Marco's for dinner. See my picture for how it arrived. The driver apparently had to slam on his brakes pretty hard to cause this, yet lacked the awareness to check his pizzas for damage.\n\nWe ate the pizza anyway and it was good, nonetheless. I called Marco's and was promised a credit for the pizza, which we can use on our next order. I'm not sure there will be a next order.
