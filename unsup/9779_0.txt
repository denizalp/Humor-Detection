Currently eating at the buffet. Great foods, service, and atmosphere. My favorites included the chicken pot pie and cold pressed juices. My only question is why you would have your hard working hostesses wear hard heeled pumps. Every step they take, I can see the discomfort and pain on their faces. Who's ever idea this was needs to have their head examined. Save the hostesses feet and change their shoes.
