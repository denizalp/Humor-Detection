When I first seen all this built I didn't think it would be successful and get much traffic but boy was I wrong. This is a great addition to Las Vegas Blvd and certainly worth checking out. I often frequent Yard House, Brooklyn Bowl, Gordon's Fish and Chips, and more. The High Roller is actually fun and discounted for locals. I'll be back often for sure.
