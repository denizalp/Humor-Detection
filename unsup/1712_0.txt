This place is scary and ghetto. First pulled up and the gal is pressuring about repairing a tiny crack even though my boyfriend said no then saying \"Progressive is a pain in the ass anyway\" Waiting in the convenient store\/DMV and two employees are arguing about shifts right in front of me. THEN two more employees are yelling at each other and cursing loudly in the bay area. I was very uncomfortable and felt like I would be caught in the middle of a senseless fight or something. Will not ever come back here again.
