I was skeptical. But these are honest to God, great bagels! Its a bit of a hole in the wall, and I'm no snob. But I will go out on a limb and say that these are the best bagels I've ever had. I got the mish-mosh bagels and plain, went home, might I say, made epic bagel sandwiches. Friendly service too! Really nice lady helped me out. I'll never buy pre-packaged frozen bagels again. This place gets an A+!
