I was surprised by how good our meal was here.  My Thai standards are very high after living in Portland, Or.  We enjoyed the green curry, shrimp fried rice, and lettuce wraps.  Everything was really good.  I generally like things quite spicy and have found that Thai hot is hotter than American hot.  I ordered medium spicy and everything was very spicy.  Keep that in mind as you order.
