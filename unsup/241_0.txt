Ok I will keep this short\n\nSaturday night 2items plus fired rice entered my stomach followed by 7 shots of alcohol, all the food was back out from my mouth 2 hours later.\n\nBut seriously this location is ok, the food wasn't too hot around 6pm regular dinner time, nothing special compare to other Pandas.
