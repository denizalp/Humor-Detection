Every party has a pooper...and I guess that's me. \n\nI just don't understand the rave reviews for this place. I wanted to love it. \n\nMy brioche egg sandwich\/salad (practically had a plate full of arugula on it) was not that good. Then to pay $20+ for 2 and have it served on a styrofoam plate? \n\nThought, well maybe I will try the cookies. Bad idea...just not tasty.\n\nMaybe just not my kind of place... Maybe it's all in my head... That's fine...but won't be in my belly ever again.
