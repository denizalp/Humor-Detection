Great customer service and lenses! This is one of my favorite places to purchase glasses. I've been coming since a child and continue to go back when I travel back to Phoenix. They are so diligent in helping you find a pair that looks amazing on you that you love. The glasses are a little more expensive, but they are finding cool designers from all over the world. I will continue to be a patron.
