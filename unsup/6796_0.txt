I must say I was a little unsure of the place when my better half recommended we eat at Haris's for lunch. Pita Grill? Just like Pita Jungle? Daphne's? They're all the same right? No. Haris's is so much better. The owner, Haris, makes everything to order himself. It is so fresh, so good, so yummy. I had a prosciutto sandwich. It it was fantastic. This little spot is our new once a week eatery. I highly recommend Haris's.
