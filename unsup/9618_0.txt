I saw my friend post about this \"secret pizza\" place on his facebook wall a few months ago, so when I went to vegas I knew I had to try it. We waited in line for more than 40 mins. Their pizza must be THAT good... when I got my slice - Meh! I guess I was expecting more from the good reviews. It was alright (too salty actually!)... not amazing and not worth the 40 mins wait time. I should have gotten something from white castle outside Harrah's instead... yep there's white castle in Las Vegas!
