Our stay at the Colonnade Apartment Homes has been the best! The management staff is so friendly and efficient, the atmosphere is nice and feels like a community. Plus, the apartments are a great size and feature working appliances that, if need be, can be fixed quickly by maintenance.  The pool is clean and is great for BBQs, and the staff has hosted BBQs for all the residents to prove it!\n\nI was initially attracted to the Colonnade Apartments because of their accommodating leases, and I am so happy we stayed and lived at the Colonnade Apartments
