I had an excellent cup of coffee, eggs, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The fruit was delicious! When they say \"fresh,\" they mean it! After spending a week on the strip and eating and drinking more junk then I could handle, this joint was just what I needed. The prices were still too high for your typical breakfast food. For two eggs, a bowl of fruit, and coffee, my meal was over $10. I guess we were just not far enough away from the strip to have real diner prices.
