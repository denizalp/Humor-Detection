Muji is the equivalent of Apple Store for the Stationary apparati. Sure, you could spend much less money on a TaoBao or Alibaba pencil or stationary supplies, but why not get something great once and for all? The sleek and clean design of the pens and containers are simply incomparable for its functionality and application. \n\nWould I pay $2 for a pen? Yes, if it's Muji. Would I pay $5 for a specific type of pen? Yes, again. Would I fulfill my OCD tendency of collecting a series of products from one brand? Yes, if it's Muji.
