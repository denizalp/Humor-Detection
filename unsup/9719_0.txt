It's an interesting gimmicky concept for a restaurant. Hospital based setting, staff in nurses outfits. They make you wear a hospital gown as soon as you walk in. \n\nCash only. They have an ATM if you don't have any cash on you. \n\nYou can get spanked by one of the waitresses if you don't finish your food. If you weigh over 350 pounds be sure to get weighed, you eat for free! \n\nStaff are nice and energetic. Food is terrible. It's borderline edible. Keep in mind you are coming here for the experience not the food.
