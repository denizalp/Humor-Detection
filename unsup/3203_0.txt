Took badger bus between Chazen museum and Goerke's corner almost every weekend in the past 2 years. Strongly recommended.\n\nWe bought the Badger Dollars for a 33% discount, thus reduced the round trip expense to about $28. It's usually 1.5hr which is similar to driving- overall better than driving alone.  It definite will take longer if you get off at MKE airports or downtown due to the several stops in between.\n\nThe drivers are very nice and professional. Bus is on time (+-10 min) for all most all occasions except heavy snow.
