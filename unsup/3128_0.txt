I agree with the rudeness. your front end people need training in good customer service. And I have been belittled by doctor's and asked to be seen by another doctor, also wrote a letter to the hospital about the treatment I received. Not all of us are just going to sit there and take the abuse. I suggest to all who received bad treatment to report it. It shouldn't be that way....white business's would fire you in a minute and hire another in another second because your losing business for them.
