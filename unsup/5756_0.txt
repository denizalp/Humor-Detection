I've never been disappointed with the food here.  It's always been slow service and on weekends there is usually a wait to be seated, but as long as I prepare for that in advance, it's totally worth it.  \n\nI enjoy walking here on lazy days with visiting friends or my boyfriend, sometimes in our PJs.\n\nMy favorites are the Bunny Rancheros, Soysage Herb Gravy Biscuits, Veggie Nachos, Seared Tuna Sandwich, and the Tilapia with Butternut Squash Risotto.
