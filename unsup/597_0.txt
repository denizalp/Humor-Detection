My partner and I stopped in here today and were completely ignored by the employee (no hello, no head nod, not even any eye contact) who nevertheless somehow found it inside himself to greet those who entered after us. Perhaps our Converse and jeans make us too déclassé to shop at Cornerstone, and while money may not be able to buy us class, that thousand bucks we almost dropped on what was admittedly a gorgeous sofa is going to go to another store whose employees will at least acknowledge their (potential) customers.
