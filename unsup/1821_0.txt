A truly classic fox restaurant. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with Italian sausage, utterly delicious. Roasted artichoke hearts as good as it gets.  The wild mushroom pappardelle pasta was fantastic and The sea scallops with white polenta were equally scrumptious.  Energy filled vibe, good wine list, excellent service and a really nice atmosphere. This  is a \"go to\" for me when I am in Scottsdale.
