Great neighborhood spot! I've been in lots for lunch, dinner, drinks... It's just a few minutes from my house and an easy place to land when we get a spur of the moment urge to go out. Their wings are great. Beer selection is really great. My boyfriend loves their nachos. My favorite is the roasted veggie pizza. This location (Cotswold) is really family friendly.
