Why won't Helen Keller drive? \n\nBecause she has to park in a shady neighborhood every time she goes to Oregano's. \n\nBut other than that I hear, I mean, I see her signing that she loves the meatball sandwich and pizza this place has. \n\nService gets a little slow because this place is always packed but if you get the stuffed mushrooms it makes it worth it. \n\nAlso, they only have one dessert, which makes it easy for your date to choose...or sign
