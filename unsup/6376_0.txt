My favorite place. Best sushi in town. Great service. I practically live here.. order the pork belly as thin sliced and a little crispy. The Ecstacy and Supreme Salmon are my fav. Most of the nigiri is amazing. I've been coming here for 3 years and will never stop! Yes, it gets crowded. Yes they get backed up. But it's by far worth the wait!
