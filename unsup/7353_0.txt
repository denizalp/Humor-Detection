Meh, nothing really special. The chief appeal of Secret Pizza is that it's a convenient (if somewhat hidden) food option inside the Cosmopolitan, and probably one of the cheapest in the vicinity at that. As is to be expected, the pizza is 3 stars if you're sober, 4 if you're buzzed, and 5 if you're totally trashed. Predictably, the lines can be long, and are filled with tons of 20-something revelers who can barely contain themselves in their semi-inebriated states. \n\nHighest-rated pizza in Vegas?! Seriously, folks, you could do better, especially given the prices.
