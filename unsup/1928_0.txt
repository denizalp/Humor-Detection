It should be called the dessert buffet.\n\nI loved the chocolate covered strawberries, cotton candy, ice cream, frozen yogurt, fruit tarts, cakes, etc etc.\n\nSweet Tooth be the death of me.  Everything else was standard.  \nPrice $22 per person. \n\nSpecial Shout out to the wait staff, especially the guy from El Salvador!
