I had a root canal\/cap done by Dr. White before he moved shop and opened up his own practice.  I find it amazing frankly that people complain about root canals being so painful.  He was decently fast, it really didn't hurt and at this point it's been years since the repair and I have had no problems at all.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr White and if I lived in AZ I would drive hours to get there.  \nThanks Dr White!!
