I have ordered the garlic ramen bowl Cha Cha Cha on several of occasions. It is really hit and miss as far as consistency goes. The first couple of times I had it I was left in an orgasmic trance. I found on another visit it just did not have the same flavor profile so it left me unsatisfied. I do enjoy their steamed pork buns which are always on point. The staff is super friendly and on their game which is a nice treat! I just wish my bowl of ramen would taste the same every time.
