Gus...oh, Gus. I've driven by you for years and always wondered...\"what-if\"? What-if I had extra time for lunch; what-if I drove by and it was actually open? Well, all these \"ifs\" were answered in a recent visit. Some places, the outside can be deceiving. Hmm...not this place, the outside matches the inside unfortunately. Sticky menu's, dirty tables, salty blah food, EEK! The waitress was REALLY NICE though and looked like a veteran of the place. The food (beef & rice w\/potato side) was not worth finishing, and the initial order almost didn't occur.
