I actually like it here. Very energetic environment. Lots of good drinks. \nI've had better Korean food elsewhere but it's good enough to have a good time with friends, and I think that's the whole idea behind this joint. \nService was excellent. Cracks me up when the staff is trying to figure out whether to speak to me in Korean or not, but nevertheless, they were cool.
