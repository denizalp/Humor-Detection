Went into this place with my mom who had bad swelling in her foot, which she has previously had surgery on. The place was beautifully decorated, clean, and new. The receptionist and nurse were amazing! The doctor was nice as well. He ended up sending us to the ER because he couldn't do the blood work needed to confirm an infection which was frustrating but needed to be done.
