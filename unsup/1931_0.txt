Good place to take out for pizza, wings. They have a $29.99 deal with a 1 topping large pizza, 8 tenders, 20 wings and a 2-liter. Not the greatest pizza but solid, wings are good and I recommend plain tenders with side buffalo as they get soggy and texture sort of nasty after that. Overall place is good for delivery when feeling a little rough from a night of reality on the strip.
