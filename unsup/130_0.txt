I filed a complaint with the NV Attorney General and the NV DMV.  Seems Jiffy Smog are repeat offenders.  Per the investigator, this particular establishment has had complaints about this before.  \n\nI strongly urge you to AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT AT ALL COSTS.  They institutionally  practice unfair and deceptive business practices aimed at scamming you out of small amounts of money.  Every few dollars they scam you x each person they purposely scam = lots of money.
