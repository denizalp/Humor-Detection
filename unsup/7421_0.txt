Dig this place for the packed terrace in the summer, but maybe even more so for a cozy mellow midweek 5a7 on the black couches when it's cold out. Very friendly, very bilingual staff who are relaxed and know their business, and who will sometimes surprise you with a uke story if the mood is just right. They do a nice latte here too and I appreciate the dark but clean, classy but not fancy vibe.
