Completely not what I expected. The university is BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN. They do a great job in giving students hands on experience. They purchased a hotel and a golf course to hand over to the students in their hospitality and golf course management programs to run. Their engineering program is growing, undergrads that are pre-med have the opportunity to work in cadavers. \n\nThey also make sure the students are engaged in student life. There is something constantly going on from games to movies on the lawn and more. \n\nI would have no problem sending my kids here!
