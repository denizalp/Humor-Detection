Do not go in this store. Seriously. It's like a museum. They have all of the Manolos, even the hard to find styles. Do not try on any shoes while in here. You will become intoxicated and will buy them. And, then you will be broke. Seriously, this is the place to go if you love shoes. Even the air in the store smells extra special. Love Manolo Blahnik. Love.
