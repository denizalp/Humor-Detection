Walmart Supercenters are great because of low prices, and it is a one stop shop. However, if you want to run in and out for a couple of things or just groceries, I like my Walmart Neighborhood Mart on Glendale. I like the clean shelves and how compact everything is. When I usually spend an hour in the Supercenter, I am in and out in 20 minutes.
