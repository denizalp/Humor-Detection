Came here with my best friend and we ordered rice cake and their noodles for lunch as we skipped breakfast and were extremely hungry. Both of us got diarrhea from it.....I have a sensitive stomach so I get diarrhea pretty frequently (once a month), no biggy, bad food. My best friend's diarrhea was so bad (ill skip the details) that she had to go to the hospital.\nNever coming back again......
