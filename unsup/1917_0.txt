I've been going to Infiniti for 3+ years and I absolutely love it! I have gone to several different nail techs and I've never been disappointed. I finally found the perfect one! Kayla is literally the best at doing coffin shaped nails! She always does exactly what I ask and more! Everyone is very friendly and it's never hard for me to get in at the time I want. They have so many gel color options I never know what to choose!
