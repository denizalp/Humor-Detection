Absolutely excellent. I ordered beef dry noodles, which were thick and chewy, and so fresh! The beef was also very fresh, even though we went quite late in the evening. My order came with a side of broth as well, which I was thankful for when I needed a little more moisture to mi everything around in. Very delicious, and huge portions.\n\nWaitress was nothing but nice, even in the packed restaurant. Watching the chef make the noodles right where you come in is super novel and fun too.
