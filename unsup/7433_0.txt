What a joke. First day I wait, the guy finally called me and told me he couldn't be there in the quoted time, so I rescheduled for the next day. I never got a call the next day so I called and the guy didn't even have me in the books, and told me he'd be here an hour and a half after my quoted time! I told him to cancel and he hung up on me!
