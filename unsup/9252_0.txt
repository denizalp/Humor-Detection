There is nothing quite like the Common Market Plaza Midwood. At all times, you will find a diverse crowd gathered around the picnic tables in front. Great people-watching locale! Inside you will find everything from deli sandwiches and craft beers to ice cream, greeting cards and \"interesting\" other things to purchase.\nI can attest to the fact that you need to visit a time or two to \"get\" the vibe and what's available. My first review was not stellar but I think that was due more to my operator error! I'm a big fan now.
