Absolutely worst brunch ever.   There are 4 of us that try different brunches and I recommended this restaurant and so sorry I did.   The eggs and potatoes appear to be pre cooked.  Potatoes were cold and hard like they had been setting for several hours.  Bacon was not cooked very well and super greasy.  Quiche was best of the 4 and it was mediocre at best.  Carnitas bowl very bland.    First and very last visit for sure!!
