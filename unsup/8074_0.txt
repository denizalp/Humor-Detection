First of all my closet is bigger!! You go in turn around and you're out!! Since I had to come here, I was going to get some candy....they had my childhood favorite....Sixlets!!!! As i start picking up different candies to see which of the lame selection I would choose, the kid at the register (who should have been in school at the time) starts ringing up everything I pick up. Really!!!! I found this rude...and annoying!!! Oh, and he didn't even know the right prices. I will not be back!!!!
