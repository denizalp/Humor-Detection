Never actively listened to the Beetles much. Everyone hears their music but I never knew how much I heard until the Love Show nor how much music they influenced.\nI understand why some people may not have enjoyed it as much.  Especially if they don't like Beatles music or were expecting more acrobatics, but the show was just downright fun.\nThough, there should be a warning regarding all the lights.\nIt is probably the closest you'll get to a beetles concert \/ music video.\nI definitely want to go again, but next time with a different state of mind.
