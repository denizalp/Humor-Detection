The friendliest group of staff I have ever met! If you're a fan of earl grey, definitely give Mr. Grey a try. It was flavourful  and wasn't too sweet. We also really enjoyed the \"Thai Me Up\", can't go wrong with either flavours. \n\nRolled icecream is a great concept and watching the staff make them was a fun experience. Service was fast and prices are pretty reasonable. If you love icecream, this place is a must try!
