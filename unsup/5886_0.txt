Radical Reptile Fun helped make our son's 10th birthday the best we've ever thrown.  Mike was professional, funny, thoughtful, and he really knows his stuff.  We got excellent photos, and the kids had a wonderful time.  Looking back at the absolutely delighted pictures of my son, I'm so glad we chose Radical Reptiles.  They really are much better than laser tag or a trampoline place.
