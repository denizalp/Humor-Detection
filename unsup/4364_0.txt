I rarely write bad reviews. I'm literally walking out of their office right now in Biltmore because they turned me away because I was seven minutes late.The entire reason why I am going to see them is because I got my ear cleaned out by them 7 days ago and now I haven't been able to hear out of my left ear for 5 days. \n\nThe arrogant receptionist told me to go to an urgent care doctor and said I can't wait to be next in line.
