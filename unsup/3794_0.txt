WHY MUST YOU BE SO FAR AWAY!!\n\nThey play live music, and the prices are astoundingly cheap for the exceptional quality of the food. I thought there had to be a catch to it. I ordered a large plate with three gigantic kalbi ribs, shrimp tempura and two scoops of rice. Total price? $11. I was so full and it made me think of what traditional home cooked Hawaiian food must taste like.
