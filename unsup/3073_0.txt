I have only ONE complaint about this restaurant; their plates are much too small!\n\nIf you're in the mood for a buffet that's got a little bit of everything, this is your place. My first experience here was like arriving to Disneyland. I had no idea where to start. They have sushi, and yummy tempura veggies, and lamb skewers that are to die for. They've got everything from teriyaki chicken to dim sum. And even soups, and desserts!\n\nDang, I wish my stomach was bigger.....\n\nWell, not really.\n\nBut for $9.99, you can't get more bang for your buck anywhere.
