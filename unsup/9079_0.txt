I have been getting my eyebrows done by Sadia Tarrar since 1999.  She is meticulous and always does a perfect job at the most reasonable prices.  Will fix any botched eyebrow job without a wince (believe me I have been there).  Her services include facials, mani pedis, waxing, threading, etc.  HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her for all of the above and cannot sing her praises enough.  She is absolutely wonderful and would NEVER let anyone else in Vegas touch my face.
