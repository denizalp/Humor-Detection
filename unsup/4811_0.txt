This is my favorite neighborhood Japanese restaurant. They have a great happy hour, the bento boxes are a fantastic deal, sushi is always fresh, ramen, and pork belly are to die for. Service is the absolute best I have ever received at this type of restaurant, ( if they are very busy service is a little slower but still very friendly and accommodating).  Definitely give this place a try, we need to support local businesses doing things right and this place is a gem!
