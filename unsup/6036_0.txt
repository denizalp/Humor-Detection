Great sandwiches for the price.  Good amount of toppings.  Nice that they have specials (usually pastas) for each day too.  I had a veal sandwich and will definitely be coming back to try other sandwiches.  It's a small place with little seating, but probably sufficient given that most customers are near by office workers.
