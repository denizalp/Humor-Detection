This little ice cream shop sells scoops of ice cream as well as Hispanic desserts.  They offer two freezers full of Blue Bunny ice cream flavors.  They also have snowballs, smoothies, shakes, sundaes, banana splits, fruit pops, and an assortment of frozen treats in their freezer.   They also serve nachos and cheese and fruit desserts.  They also have some things on the menu that I'm not sure what it is.  The main thing for me was that this place is clean, nicely decorated, and very reasonably priced!  I will be back.
