Delicious!!! I've never had a crepe before until trying hazelnuts.  Surprisingly my favorite crepes aren't the sweet ones, but the savory ones. \n\nThey have a bunch of options on the menu (10+) so there's something for everyone. You can't go wrong with the pesto chicken and the southwestern veggie. The southwestern is amazing and is hands down my favorite one!!!\n\nFor dessert you must try the Nutella and strawberry crepe. It's too tasty!
