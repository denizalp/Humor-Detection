I loved the way my nails looked the day of but then one of them broke off when I woke up the next day. Then the other 2 broke at work while typing on my computer. Nails have no quality their and are highly priced. On top of it they were talking about one of the other employees who works there like as if I was not there and new it was my first visit. The only thing good about this place is those good nails for only 24 hours. Never going again. First and last visit.
