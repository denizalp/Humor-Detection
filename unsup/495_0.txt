The ice cream tasted great, and the combinations you can get are awesome and unique. However, they were not well-stocked and were down to one size cup. Also they were understaffed...sort of. There was a third employee in the back who came out and filled up his drink at the soda machine and then walked to the back room while the other two associates were SLAMMED with customers. If you are a patient person, the taste is worth the wait and inconvenience.
