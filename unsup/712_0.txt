If you are on the south end of the strip, or staying at the Silverton Hotel and Casino and get hungry for a burger this is the place to go. I ordered a number one combo. It consists of a double double cheeseburger, fries and soda. I got the onions grilled.\n     The fries were salted well and the burger was stacked high. It smelled so good I could not even wait long enough to take a picture. The only thing holding me back from giving five stars is the burger could have had more grilled onions put on it.
