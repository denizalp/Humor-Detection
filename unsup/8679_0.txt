Worst experience ever. Horrible management. My friend's ID just got expired like one week. But I have a valid ID. But their staff doesn't even let us stand in lobby. And kick both of us out of the hotel. The guy who names Nicholas is yelling at us to get out and saying dirty words to us..... So this is the services provided by encore? I'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
