After dropping in for a regular fix of loud rock music last night, I realized they were having an anniversary party for the bar. \nIt has been 8 years so far with no chance of slowing down, this place has been my neighbourhood go-to with their cheap and dirty weekend shows letting us enjoy big talent up close and personal, as well as mid week parties with drink specials. \nKeep rocking Cheery Cola's- you're the best!
