Good, solid food.  Not great food, just good.  I went here for lunch with a friend.  We sat at the chef's bar, which overlooks the kitchen, which was nice because the chef gave us a little sampling of the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh Salad, which was pretty good.  I ordered the chicken and corn chowder to start, which was delicious!  For my meal, I had the chopped salmon salad, which was good also.  \n\nLike I said, the food was good, but not great.  I'd like to try out this place for happy hour so I can try some more items.
