Excellent food and super service. We went there once for dinner and once for the lunchtime buffet. Both were excellent. Had chicken Tikka Masala and Mutton Rogan Josh for dinner with garlic naan (perfection). The lunch buffet had a very good assortment of vegetarian dishes as well as non-vegetarian dishes and appetizers and desert if you have room. We really enjoyed both meals. We will definitely return
