I think my GPS secretly wants me dead. Of all places to be running on empty. The pumps out of gas of course no sign saying so. Between finding a pump with gas and telling two guys I had no money or cigs to give it was a nightmare.  Ladies fill up before entering or leaving the sketchy side of town. What a dump
