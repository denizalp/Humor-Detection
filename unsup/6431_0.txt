Bad experience. The food had no flavor. I ordered combination fried rice. The meat tastes old and smelled funny. The rice tasted so plain like no salt. The mustard chili sauce not only do they sell it on the side but it has no flavor either. I also noticed the prices are higher than the other China a GO Go I have gone. Will not ever be coming back.
