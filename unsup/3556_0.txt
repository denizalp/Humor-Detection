So disappointed.  Extremely over-priced wine menu.  Ordered appetizers and wine before dinner.  Calamari soaked in oil, everything highly over priced for poor quality of food.  When asked ounce amount of steaks or fish, wait staff had no idea.  Very poorly trained staff and obviously poor management.  Left after appetizers and wine.
