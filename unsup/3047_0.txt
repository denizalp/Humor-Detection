One of the best places for lunch in town.  My favorites are the Havarti and Asparagus sandwich and the Thai Chicken Wrap.  It can get busy around lunch time but that's a good sign.  DO NOT MISS THE BAKED GOODS!  They are some of the best in town.  Their former location was a bit cuter in decor and more intimate so it doesn't get a full 5 stars from me but I would definitely recommend Bertha's!
