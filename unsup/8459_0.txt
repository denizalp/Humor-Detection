Really eclectic mix of flavors and ingredients.  By the time we got around to eating there we had consumed enough pub food for the week and decided to try some off-the-wall stuff.  It was tasty, but the sandwiches and fries people were eating looked FAR better!  Good beer selection and incredibly cool\/friendly staff!
