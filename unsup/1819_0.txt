As you would expect from a chinese restaurant, the service stinks.  There's one negative.  Here's another: the food is kinda crappy.  I ordered the beef stew with dumpling noodle soup.  It's too bad the soup broth ruined the otherwise decent noodle soup.\n\nThe mongolian beef is actually good.  They're huge pieces though so you'll need their dull butter knives to help you cut the beef.  Doh!  Forget it.  Just gnaw on it until the beef breaks off.
