I guess there is a reason why this place is called Secret Pizza...because nobody wants you to find out about it since it sucks...pizza sucks, customer service sucks, the environment sucks, and finding the location sucks.\n\nMy friends and I wanted pineapple in our pizza and they were extremely rude by saying they don't have fruit on their pizza. I think they should check their biology because tomatoes and peppers are a fruit!\n\nThe sauce was tart, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wait was a waste of our time!
