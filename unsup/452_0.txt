I have been to \"The Nose\" about four times now and I absolutely love this restaurant! I'm new to TO and tried this place one night and now it's my go to restaurant :) Anytime we have guests in from out of town, we come here.  Service is great, ambience\/vibe is perfect, not too loud but definitely not quiet.  And the food,  I love it! Dish sizes are great, price is right, and the service\/food has been amazing every time.\nMy fave so far: Pulled pork wrapped in beef with goat cheese... Dee-lish!
