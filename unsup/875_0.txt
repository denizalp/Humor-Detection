On the evening I picked for date night, I'm glad I made reservations. We had a lovely table by the window, and everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. Hint: this isn't just the plum wine talking, because I'm writing my review well after its effect has worn off and just the memory remains. My wife and I wanted to experience a quieter, cozier Japanese dining ambiance, and they made it happen.
