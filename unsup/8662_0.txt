Service was horrible . When we asked to speak to a manager after 20 minutes the cook came out and had an attitude . After we explained our issues we were told to \"f off\" . After that the manager \"Chris\" came out and started yelling at us and told us to leave and never come back. We recorded part of it and we plan on contacting the better business bureau.
