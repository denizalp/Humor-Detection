I recently visited Martin's Bakery because I heard about it through a friend of mine. I was very disappointed. The quality of the food was very poor compared to other Tamil restaurants\/take-out places I have been to. In addition, their customer service was very poor. I found a hair in my mutton roll and I told the person working there about it and he told me I was lying. That's how you get customers!
