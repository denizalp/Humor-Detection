WOW, as soon as I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. It was so welcoming and everyone was very friendly, felt like I was back home at my neighborhood bar.  The food was great and service with a smile. I really felt welcome and will definately make Hammer's one of my favorite places to relax and unwind.
