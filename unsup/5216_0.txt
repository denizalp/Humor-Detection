I found this place just by pure luck. I'm always looking for cheap places to eat breakfast, and Beanos hits the spot. They have a $3.99 breakfast special before 11am that has 2 eggs, 2 bacon, toast, and potato selection. For $5.99 you can get 3 eggs and 3 bacon 24 hours a day. The food is good, the service is good....I really like coming here for a quick quiet breakfast.
