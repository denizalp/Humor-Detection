Had an awesome time at Social Hall last night. Coconut Shrimp was amazing with just a hint of spicy in the sauce and the Green Chili Fries were tasty. Absolutely loved my Moscow Mule ordered. Oh and let's not forget about those strawberry churros.. WHOA! I love the fact that all the games in the place are free to play. Also appreciate the free t shirt and gift certificate given to each and every Yelper. Thank you Social Hall, I will be back with friends!!
