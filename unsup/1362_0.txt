This a great little bar inside the Luxor, if that is where you find yourself. They have a very reasonable happy hour when comparing it to regular strip prices. The cocktail service was fast and friendly and the bartender knows how to make a tasty drink. I've been here a few times now, the prices and service will keep me as a repeat customer!
