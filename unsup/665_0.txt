They have moved to 6100 E Independance Blvd. \n\nMoms with little kids, this is the one for you. They have a ??? 15? foot bear the owner shot on display. Otherwise, it's one huge warehouse room they can run and scream and still not bother anyone while you shop. Wall to wall, bound remnant, fashion rugs. Really nice guys, took great care of me when I needed a rug the day before I gave birth.
