Holy Bunny McDougal's batman! Each time I go to this Teeter I feel like I am the only person who isn't old money, a wasp and  who doesn't go to the church across the street. That being said, if I do go I try to get in and out in a hurry, it's good if you need to drop in really quick to pick up a general supermarket item. But other than that.....no.
