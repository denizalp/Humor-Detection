Food options around my workplace are plentiful. Some are awesome, some are meh. Thanks to yelp I found this hidden gem and I am extremely happy about it. \nSo far I have had a rueben sandwich, an asian chicken salad and a burger here.\nThe rueben was really good and so was the burger. The salads here are meh, I had a Greek salad that had 4 pieces of tomato and 4 cucumber slices, stay away from the greens and stick to the sandwiches. The owners are nice and no nonsense. They have a great little place here.
