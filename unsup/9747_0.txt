Was pissed when I ordered and it took almost an hour and a half - they explained it was due to a power outage which makes sense because it was almost 40 degrees out today. Felt bad about only tipping 10% due to the late service because the food was friggin awesome! Bloomin onion was bomb - def. recommend! I had the philly pizza sub - wife had traditional Philly cheese steak - both thoroughly enjoyed. Will order again.
