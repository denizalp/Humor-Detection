I'm here right now at the buffet writing this review. I'm a registered guest at Harrah's. I waited on line for 30 minutes and it wasn't even busy!!!! There were not a lot of people in the restaurant. One cashier (poor lady)   which was the first line I waited on and then another line where I had to wait for super slow hostess who also had a bad attitude to walk me to my table!! This is ludicrous!!!  Where are the employees?????\n\nAnd to boot the buffet is TERRIBLE!! I waited on line for THIS???? Never again!!!
