I've been coming here on a regular basis (1-2x\/month minimum) for the past 5 years and I've never had to pay cover... until now. I've always loved this bar because of the \"neighborhood bar\" atmosphere, and I've enjoyed the fact that it's within walking distance from my home, but with the recent changes to the happy hours, and now having to pay a cover, I'm thinking I'll start taking a cab to another bar...
