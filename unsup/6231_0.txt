I would never recommend this place to anyone. The staff and management were horrible and completely unhelpful. When I had an issue and spoke with the manager she just basically said, screw you, we've got your money and you're not getting it back. The facility was not that great and overall I was very disappointed with the park. Save your money and go somewhere else.
