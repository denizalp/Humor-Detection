Been coming here for years. I love love love this place!! Their 'The Works' skillet is amazing and so is their French Toast. It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!! Jaime is the best waitress ever!! Ask for her!
