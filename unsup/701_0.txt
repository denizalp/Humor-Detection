We are Jun's fans, even of this location which is not on our side of town.  I always get the Kalbi plate because theirs is so flavorful and consistent.  We have a location near us in North Las Vegas, but this one is good for when we eat out with our Henderson peeps.  Service is fast and friendly and the food is great!  If you like Korean food, especially kalbi, give Jun's a go.
