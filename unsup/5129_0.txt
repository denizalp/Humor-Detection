It seems that Two Drops has had some issues with their start up particularly with the scheduling of clients. My guess is that the overwhelming Groupon response has caused some chaos and the management just wasn't prepared for the traffic. However, I booked my appointments in advance and have a pretty good experience there. Rosario is the one who has done my facials and she's very personable and sweet. I appreciate good \"bed side manner\" at med spas so I like her very much. Hopefully Two Drops of Beauty can continue to progress organizationally and get more positive feedback.
