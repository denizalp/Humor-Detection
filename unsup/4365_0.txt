Croissants are amazing, fresh baguette made in-house among everything else, fresh ingredients  and illy coffee. The passion of the owner is reflective in his menu and his hospitality is above any cafe owner I've run into out here in vegas. The place reminds me of being in north beach San Francisco. My only complaint is that this place needs to be open on the weekend or sometime when I can make the trek out to the westside.
