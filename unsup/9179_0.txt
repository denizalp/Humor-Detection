another quick style appointment. brazilian wax, with sarah.\n\n& omg. she's AMAZING. she plays so much attention to detail, it's really crazy. \n\nshe is also very professional and very opened and friendly all at once. i definitely felt most comfortable with her for some reason (not saying i didn't with danieli or helen.. i saw danieli about 6-8 times.. helan once. but i felt most comfortable with sarah).\n\nstill don't like the name of the spa, but whatevers. for a brazilian, there is no other place to go.
