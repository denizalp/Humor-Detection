Outstanding service, Excellent decorMarvelous steak, Lobster bisque is to die for. Creamed spinach and the au gratin potatoes made to perfection. Would have given it 5 stars but wine list is a bit pricey. Desserts were all outstanding with tbe bread pudding winning the best reviews.\nBe sure to ask for the prix fixe option. Outstanding deal $50.00 per person for a 4 course meal.
