Great little place that is VERY hard to find. Look for the sign on the door and you may have a fighting chance. \nWe had a large party and got a table easy but that was probably just luck. The food was excellent. One person got the roasted garlic app- it was huge. The Quesidilla was great. The beans were not the best but everything was good.
