Jim is extremely helpful and wonderful; he doesn't jip you or low-ball you on any prices :) He is extremely reasonable and easy to work with. I took in two diamond rings to sell and quite honestly I was given more money back than I expected. Exceptional service and staff. I will be back to buy my next pav√© ring (yes, I've already picked it out - and beware, it's so sparkly it will blind you if you look directly at it. Lol)
