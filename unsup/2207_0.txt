Perfect diner for a late night snack. Great huge portions right on the Strip. Saw one guy eat a chicken fried mozzarella steak hero sandwich with onion rings tooth picked into the top. Five minutes into it, his eyeballs turned white with 3 sevens across them. He fell out of the booth and yelled, \"I just paid off!\" That's a late night Vegas diner, baby.
