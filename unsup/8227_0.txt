Love COBS bread! You gotta try their Turkish Bread, Capeseed, Rye, Country Grain, Chia.... okay try it all!  Everything is made fresh each day from scratch (I know this because my husband is a baker).  Chocolate scones are a favourite of ours too!  Prices are decent, as you are getting a quality product without preservatives.  Totally worth it!
