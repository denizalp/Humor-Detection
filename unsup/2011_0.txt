Paid $25 for entry for a group of 10 girls on a Saturday. Waited an hour in line if not more aaaand we were on a guest list. Wtheck?! \n\nZedd was there which didn't really make a difference to me. I'm not into that genre of music and if youre lookin for that hip hop vibe this was not the place--at least not that day. \n\nHellaaaaa crowded too and stupid people kept splashing. Grow the eff up already and quit the damn splashing!! \n\nOrdered 2 midori sours and paid $40 (including tip).
