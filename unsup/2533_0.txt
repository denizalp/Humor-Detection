Overpromise and under deliver.  Doesn't even deserve a one star rating! Upon setting this up,  we were told 24 hour notice to move the pod. We're called them six days in advance and were told 11 days is the soonest the pod can be delivered to new address. Called back to expedite and told we'd have to pay an additional $100 to get it sooner, like 9 days instead of 11.  So,  basically we pay for the companies inability to deliver as promised.  What a joke!
