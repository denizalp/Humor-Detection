Food was delicious!   Had Greek  salad & spinach pie.  Dinner included bread that tasted homemade.  Portions were very generous - enough for a second meal.   Server was very friendly and attentive.   Wish I'd had room for dessert - they looked fabulous!   :-)  I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!
