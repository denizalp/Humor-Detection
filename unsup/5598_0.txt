My friends and I ate here for the first time today. It's a small place attached to a store where you can buy middle eastern foods too.  2 of us had the gyro plate which consisted of gyro meat covered in taziki sauce, jasmine rice and a salad for $7.69. The other person had chicken shwarma with hummas & tabuli.  All plates were excellent! It's not much to look at from the outside, but don't let that fool you, the food was delicious!  Would highly recommend!!
