After getting burned by Atlas Audio, it was refreshing to take my tape duplicator here. The thing just needed a little TLC, and Vince was just the man to service it. He located the problem (which was not what the chumps at Atlas had said it was) fixed it quickly, and provided the service at a reasonable price. He was very informative, and didn't seem burdened when I asked questions. All in all, a great experience. Hope I don't have to get this thing fixed again any time soon, but when\/if I do, I'll be going back to Galaxie.
