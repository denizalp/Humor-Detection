I started coming to fit life several weeks ago with my fianc√© and am very happy with my experience and results thus far. John, Craig and Nick have made me feel comfortable and push me to a limit within my level of fitness. They are attentive and conscientious, aware of my fitness goals and offer motivation and support. I attend sessions twice weekly and they are always able to accommodate my schedule.  I highly recommend fit life for anyone seeking fitness training!
