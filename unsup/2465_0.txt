My favorite club in the whole world as of today. I'm not much of a clubber but this place is like a dream. It's so huge and spacious. Fresh air to go with your drink and your 2 step. It was my first experience with the whole fist pumping scene. Felt like Jersey Shore up in here. There was this one cute persian girl I was dancing with and I had no idea how to dance to this music so we kept staring at each other just fist pumping for about 20 minutes.
