16.50? For a Sonora dog, fries and a steak burrito with large watered down Hibiscus tea at a food truck.. What a joke.. Meat in the burrito is over cooked and the fries undercooked. The hot dog was decent. The kid taking the orders was not friendly and not helpful. \n\ncaro , decía comida y antipático , tomador de pedidos inútil . 16.50 para un perro caliente con patatas fritas y una bebida grande de un burrito de carne .
