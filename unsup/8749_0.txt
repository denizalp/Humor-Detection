Solid choice for dinner or drinks. Our server was super friendly and funny. Wine list is very reasonably priced. My Waldorf salad was giant and came with a croissant. The husbands hickory burger was cooked perfectly medium rare. I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a varied menu with lots of choice.
