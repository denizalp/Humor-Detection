Best burger place in the entire GTA, my favourite item on their menu is the Atomic burger. Burgers are so fresh! the patty is moist, soft and just cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this item to all you cheese lovers. The heavenly fried cheese patty in this burger is like a party in the mouth!..*drool*. Best thing is the owner\/head chef loves what he does and puts his heart and soul into it! God bless him!\n\nGood thing I live far or I would be there everyday!!
