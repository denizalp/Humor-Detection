Absolutely wonderful. I was surprised they had a wait on a Wednesday night so I would suggest a reservation. The drink menu was amazing and they have happy house from 3pm - 6pm. I had my first ever Sicilian Mule, blew me away. Then I ordered a Carbonara and a House salad. Both perfectly made and so fresh. The Carbonara was perfectly creamy without adding cream. Great hidden gem. Even in the winter, we sat in the patio area and it was very warm and inviting.
