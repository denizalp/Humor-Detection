For a chain brunch restaurant the food is fairly good and consistent. The waffles are light and fluffy with a heaping mound of fruit. The eggs Benedict were actually perfectly cooked the two times I've had them, which is saying something as many places have difficulty not over-cooking them. One negative is I've received chipped plates and coffee mugs a couple of times.
