I bought a vaporizer last saturday and when I tried to use it it wouldn't work when I brought it back for a refund or exchange the sales clerks were very unhelpful. I than spoke to the manager who kept comparing her store to a kitchener accessories location and said \"no returns\". Not to mention how condescending and rude she was to me. \nI am a medicinal marijuana patient and I will never be returning to this establishment. Complete rip-off jokers.
