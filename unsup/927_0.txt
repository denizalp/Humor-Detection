Best coffee on CMU's campus,  but like everything on CMU's campus, expensive!  I drink simple coffee and would rather pay Cogo's price.  Still this is convenient, except between classes when lines exceed my patience level.   MAC machine nearby helps consolidate trips and with recent CMU construction this lies in one of the few viable paths through campus from Forbes.  The staff are quite nice and always seem to be enjoying their central spot.  Near Xmas it is also a nice place to indulge in a mocha latte which I wouldn't order at Cogo's. :)
