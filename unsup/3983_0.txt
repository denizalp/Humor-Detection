Saw this restaurant on tv...so I had to try today since I was waking downtown Las Vegas.\n\n- I ordered the Double Bypass burger, gross.  The bun was nothing special and the hamburger patties were tasteless and cold.\n\nPros: chicks wear sexy nurse uniforms.  Obese people eat for free.\n\nCons: burgers look awesome but taste like crap.\n\nNote: you go because it is a novelty type place...don't expect your overpriced cheeseburgers to blow you away...it won't.
