Best chop salad I've had in my entire life!!! Shop around for a chop salad as good as theirs and I can promise nothing compares! The atmosphere and Ora of the restaurant was everything you could ask for in a bar restaurant. Fun classy romantic, you name it and you can always count I them to provide it! Great spot in old town.
