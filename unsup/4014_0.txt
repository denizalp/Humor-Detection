Trevor and his staff are awesome. Very nice, very professional, and very good at what they do. They are so good because that's all they do, liposuction. Over 15,000 cases so this made me feel very comfortable that I was in good hands. \nMy results have been great so far, and looking forward to the future when they are at their best. \nIf you want exceptional liposuction and an outstanding price, you should contact My Shape Lipo for sure!
