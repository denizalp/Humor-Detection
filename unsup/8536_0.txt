This has to be one of the oldest buildings still in this mall and it really shows its age. Cant they freshen the surroundings once in a while to make my stay a bit more pleasant? Sort of makes on wonder how clean the place is.\nThe food looks and tastes fine but thhe surroundulings are pitiful.\nMy review prior review reiterated the opioions of those befre mr regarding the cleaniless of the facilitites. Perhaps the cobwebs are part of the seasonal decor now. Dont know what the reason earlier.  \nThese comments are made on observastions and opinions as observed here.
