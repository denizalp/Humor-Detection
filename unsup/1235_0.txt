Pastel Creperie has unbelievably great service, with decent desserts and drinks.\n\nI've had hot chocolate, tea and cakes here but I've never tried the crepes, so I unfortunately can't comment on them. The cakes could definitely be improved in terms of flavour, but they look incredibly scrumptious so the appearance threw me off. \n\nThey might want to think about sourcing some macarons or specialty churros to add a bit more variety to individual cakes and crepes. \n\nThis is definitely a place I could return to with a larger group of girlfriends, oddly enough despite the romantic-y vibe.
