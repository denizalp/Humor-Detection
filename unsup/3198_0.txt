Great pizza with interesting toppings in the Seventh Street Market. And they have local beer on tap, what's not to love?\n\nI got their chorizo topped pizza which also had some cilantro and fresh tomatoes. Made to order, it took a few minutes until it was brought to my table. By that time, I was well into my pint of Triple C's Golden Boy beer. I'll need another of those, please.\n\nPrices are okay ($5 for a local draft is quite reasonable) and there were enough seats around the dinner hour. Note that they do close at around 7pm.
