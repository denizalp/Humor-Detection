We just went in for some after dinner drinks and sat at the bar. The establishment is very nice and clean. We went on a Sunday night and it was very busy because it is one of the only places along the Danforth open later. The beer and drink list is extensive, and I am excited to try their own brew when it is finished. The bartender was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this place to other people going for a night out in the area.
