I order from NY quite frequently since I work close. I have ordered the pastrami sandwich twice now requesting NO MUSTARD. However over the phone they don't seem to comprehend that. After picking it up and driving back to work I find there is mustard on my sandwich. It has been 3 times that this has happened. Lost a customer.
