This place is good for grabbing a hot cup of coffee when the weather is too cold outside. Not so much for plugging in. Even though they have free WiFi, there are no outlets and their tables are tiny. Not to mention that this place get crowded on weekends. Otherwise its your usual Tim Horton's with its usual menu. I suggest North York central library for those who want to plug in.
