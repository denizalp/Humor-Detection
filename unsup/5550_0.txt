There was a bite in my daughter's sandwich!  We got Wendy's today at this location.  When my daughter opened her sandwich, there was already a child-sized bite taken OUT of her sandwich!  Called the manager and got a woman with a SEVERE attitude problem!  Husband took the sandwich back only for this chick with an attitude called us LIARS!  Yeah, we're going to travel all that way to scam 3 bucks!  NEVER, EVER AGAIN!  Sorry customer service and pre-chewed food?  NO THANK YOU!
