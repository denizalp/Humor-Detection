My Japanese wife had one word for this place.  That word was \"otaku\".  What a weird\/interesting\/cool place this was.  Conveniently next to a comic book store!  I was wondering if I was going to see Harvey Pekar around the corner.   This place might be a little scary at 11pm on a Tues night hahaha.
