Our repair tech showed up on time and was friendly and professional.  He diagnosed the issue and made recommendations based on what he found.  He made it clear he wasn't out to gouge us and even told us to consider purchasing a new unit based on the costs of additional diagnostic tests and potential repairs.  He even made recommendations on what appliances to consider when purchasing a new fridge.  Thank you for having such high standards!
