I understand the frustration of the previous reviewer.  I have been to several opticians over the past several years.  Sears does quality work and stands behind it.  Good professional people there to help you. I went elsewhere on last set and regretted it.  I came back to here and experienced the same good quality from the past.  Only negative is that they are limited in personnel so you may have to wait for service.  I have learned to check their hours before going and go right when they open.  I will be back when I need to again.
