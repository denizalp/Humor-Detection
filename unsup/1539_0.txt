If you're looking for the cheapest and fastest cleaners in town then just move along. However, If you're looking for a family-run business that will treat your garments with the care that you deserve, then look no further. I stumbled upon this place a few years ago and I won't go anywhere else! I don't get much dry cleaning done, mostly just after the holidays when I need my fancy party dresses cleaned. I'm not sure where I'll go when these awesome folks eventually retire. \n\nPS - They also do alterations but I've never used them for that.
