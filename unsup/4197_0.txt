Ever since I discovered this at Pacific Mall, I had to keep coming back. Once I found out they had a location in Markham, even better!!!\n\nTheir potato noodles are so chewy and perfect. You can ask them for extra spicy, which I always do! The menu has pictures of the food so you can easily decide what you want to order. \nI received a complimentary soy milk with my soup bowl :)\nThe prices are really affordable and it's located in a really nice plaza. \nDefinitely my go to noodle soup place!
