Space is just that a space but it's what fills this Space that makes it special. Its a large room that hosts some interesting art work. My favorite is a piece of installation art. It's tree limbs that are in the shape of Guns. Very interesting. The exhibits change regularly and if you like art this is a place to check out. \n\nI could see Space being a great place to host an event. This was my fist time so I can't speak to other exhibits but I will be back.
