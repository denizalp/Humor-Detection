I'm going to keep this simple: get the prime rib. Don't try anything else because it was absolutely amazing. I'm what you call a prime rib pro. I get it everywhere. All I can say is that I'm just blown away by how well seasoned and tender it was. Unfortunately the vegetables are wilted but who cares.
