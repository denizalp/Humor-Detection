Okay...so the food is good but not good enough to warrant the excessive wait times and chaotic name taking process. My biggest gripe is the constant confusion going on at the front of the house. It's just enough of a turn off not to go back. The 'tude you have to work through just to get a table ain't worth a super yummy sausage biscuit.
