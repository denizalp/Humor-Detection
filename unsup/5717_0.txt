What's not to love except how crazy busy this place can be. Fresh, locally grown food. Incredible flavors and fun ambiance. \n\nTuna sandwich is excellent. Get the garlic fries. And their pizza is very good. The bbq is ok but not as good as going to their other location Joes BBQ which seems odd to me. \n\nGet there early or later for lunch to help avoid the craziness.
