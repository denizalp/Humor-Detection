One of my top favorite bars in Las Vegas, Anthony the mixologist is extremely knowledgeable and has a fantastic beard, the drinks are out of this world!Sometimes they have a chimpanzee that plays the bar piano, he's extremely impressive! If I didn't have a job, I would go everyday and get hammered. \nI love Dan, Anthony and Aja :)
