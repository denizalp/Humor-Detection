Door flier food......oh my!\nI typically hate and almost always never try the \"door flier\" food menus that end up at my house ,but MR. EATZ  is the exception!\nIt's like bar food done exceptionally well, and it's the go-to spot for my husband and I when I don't want to cook and he can't make a decision.\nHere's why I like it and what we order:\n~White pizza.....if you love cheese order this biznatch, WTF?!?!?!\n~Meatball sub....not too saucy, doughy yet crusty bread and prefect meatballs.\n~Garlic knots.....no explanation needed!\n~Chicken finger and waffle fries!\n~Wings!\n~COUPONS galore.......great combos!\n~Fast delivery and GREAT PRICES!\n=)
