My fianc√© and I spotted this place our last day in Vegas. We wanted to see as much of Vegas as possible for the last day so we decided on renting a scooter. The staff was really accommodating and friendly. Scooter wasn't the fastest, but it got us around for a great price. Definitely recommend looking into at least for a day. Too much money is spent on cabs in Vegas and this is much more affordable.
