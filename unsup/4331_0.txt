I don't really make it on this side of town that often but this mall is definitely a nice addition. It's a good mix of stores department and specialty as well as a really large and nice movie theatre.The food court offers a great variety of options and there are several good restaurants nearby including Mimi's Cafe, Bravo's and Chilis. \n\nOverall, it makes for a pleasant shopping experience!
