Garbage........I ordered a burger with pickle, onion, and mustard only. I got a burger with everything. Take it back and tell them and I get a burger with pickle and onion....but no mustard...I go back and am given mustard packets. Cold ass chili and cold ass fries. I wasn't afraid but the freak show Mike P. describes is indeed entertaining. You have to wonder how they get the money for the garbage food.
