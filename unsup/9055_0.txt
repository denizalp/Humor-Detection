The best all-you-can-eat sushi bar in Las Vegas! Sushi House Goyemon is busy, and you can't make a reservation. I recommend getting their early because this is a small restaurant. I loved my meal and stuffed myself to the gills. It was easy to do because the dishes are prepared right in front of you. I really felt entertained watching the sushi chef, and I think I felt hungrier because of it. I ate so much, I could barely move. Guess what? I'll come back again soon!
