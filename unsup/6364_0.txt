I needed to get a filling for my nails and stumbled across this place. I was actually looking for a different nail salon but wasn't able to find it. I went in, and Stacy the nail technician was very nice and greeted me. She gave me so many choices of colors that they had, and then started with my nails. She was very personable and friendly. My nails turned out great!! I think I would go back to this place.
