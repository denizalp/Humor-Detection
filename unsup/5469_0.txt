Dana was super helpful in educating us about the different aspects and options in purchasing a pool table.  After showing us a table that would match our home perfectly, he provided a quote that was reasonable and in line with the market.  Dana and Eric even sweetened the deal a little so I could not refuse and made the process simple. \n\nI can't wait to take delivery of the table.  I will update the review once we receive.
