It's funny, I think my first experience at this store was more enjoyable than most dates I go on. In fact, It felt like a date. I was with someone I liked, and we were entertained by for at least a good 45 min by all the interesting pets! My faves were the veiled chameleons, red foot tortoise's, a freakin marmoset! (Mini-monkey!!), huge ass pythons, a HEDGE HOG! Really? Lol. Anyway, I had fun. Even if you're not out to buy an exotic pet, it's still worth stopping by.
