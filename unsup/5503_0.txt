This pizza can be decent, but you have to eat it right away.  I've never seen pizza with a shorter half-life than this one.  Even picking this up and carrying it to your office or classroom will keep the pizza out for too long.  The most you can do is finish up a salad while this pizza waits on the plate next to you, just begging to be eaten.  Don't resist, just eat the slice and its overly-sweet tomato sauce up while you have it.  It sure as heck ain't getting any better.
