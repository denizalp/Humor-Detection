FYI for the women out there working out like me and my new personal training regimen...\nWhole Foods has the best selection of Luna protein and nutrition bars.  The protein line is new, and I get the cookie dough!  The nutrition bars - they have like 10+ flavors, everything but chai which surprised me since it is whole foods.  Just really impressed with the selection!!!
