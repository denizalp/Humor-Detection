I had been sort of so-so about Burgernator based on their veggie burger option, but my studiomate liked that they were halal, so we went fairly often. It wasn't until I was a Very Bad Vegetarian and ordered the seargent burger one night that I realized why this place is always hopping. Oh gosh. I'm sorry, cow. I'm so sorry, I know I'm not supposed to eat you. But I did eat you. And gosh. You were so good. \n\nIf I succumb to weakness again, this is definitely where I'm going to do it.
