The pizza here was so good. I had the BBQ Chicken, and it was amazing how there was no visible BBQ sauce but yet you could taste it. Whatever they are doing with their pizza, they are doing it right. The pizza dough is crispy, and fuses really well with the cheese and the ingredients. We were celebrating our friend's birthday, and the owner gave my friend a treat. Very very warm service from the staff. Reasonable price. I will definitely pay a visit here when I visit Vegas again.
