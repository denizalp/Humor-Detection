To me the food was bland... The \"spicy\" orange chicken couldn't even be labelled zesty & the fried rice was mealy... I like that it's close to my house, but it still isn't great. I'm looking for some bomb ass chinese food that's within a reasonable distance of my house (Chandler\/Gilbert border) and this place just didn't take the cake.
