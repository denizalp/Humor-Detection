I called Moore's on New Years eve when my vehicle quit in rush hour traffic on the beltline. \nBeing from out of town they looked to be the closest and their add said they provided service work. \nTheir diagnosis of my problem, over the phone, was one they could not fix but were willing to tow me anywhere in the city tonight or my hometown tomorrow. \nDriver towed me to a friends home, I was a bit hesitant to see the bill, to my surprise there was no price gouging. \nThanks for prompt and professional service under dangerous conditions.
