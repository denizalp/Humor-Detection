My son has been performing in the Jam Sessions every quarter for over a year.  He loves it so much!  He gets to perform in a real venues with a real audience at Visualite Theatre, The Chop Shop, Amos', and he feels like such a rock star!!  The band rehearses every week.  They have a great time developing their playlist and learning how to play well with others. Having the \"real world\" experience of performing on stage is priceless!  Thank you Connie Cooper for providing this opportunity for young musicians!
