We ordered The Roll. It's thick and they only serve 1 so I ordered 2 and shared it with kids - the roll was ok. We had Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein, Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef. The Mongolian Beef was too sweet. The beef was nice and tender but wished it had more flavor than being it too sweet. The orange chicken was good but the kids mostly liked the Fried Rice and Chow Mein. I must say the staff were super friendly.
