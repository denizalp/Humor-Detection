Absolutely fabulous! I've been a fan since they debut on SYTYCD \n I wasn't sure what to expect given the show is over an hour long and what is seen before was MAYBE 15 min of dancing.\n These guys were original in the story they created, engaging even getting the crowd involved, and SO worth the money. The show was fantastic. Given that the hubby doesn't like watching \"shows\" he really enjoyed theirs, a comedy delight
