I really want to love this place. The owner is really nice and we like the menu. We love thin crust brick oven pizza but the toppings tend to be scarce. This time we ordered extra pepperoni on one and extra cheese on the other. Picture attached- if that's \"extra\" then regular toppings must mean one piece of pepperoni per piece. Sighs...
