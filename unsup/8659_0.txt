came to tea station for the first time last week. never been to a tea station before.\nOrdered a mango frozen drink and butter toast.\nThis place is really popular at night and a lot of people come here to hang out with friends.\nnot sure if it's worth coming back to try more things but I'm open to that idea.\nLots of drinks and food to choose from. Not sure on quality.\nindoor\/outdoor seating. casual.\nbring an open mind.
