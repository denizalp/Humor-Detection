My new fave Chinese food place in my area. Clean. Fast and great service. Take out general tso's chicken lunch special. Comes with egg roll, cheese puff, and had the egg drop soup as I wait since take out doesn't include soup, brown rice for addl $1. W\/ large soda total was $9. The food is delicious and highly recommend to others!
