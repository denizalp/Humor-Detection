Our 42\" Samsung LCD TV sounded like it's alternator was broken.  It sounded like it was coming on, but it just would not turn over.  He called ahead of time like he said he would and fixed our TV in our home in less than 30 minutes for exactly the price he quoted me.  He saved us the difference of $350 that we planned on spending on a new TV!  Heck of a guy!  Funny, friendly, and honest!  I'll definitely be recommending him to everyone I know!
