Partell Pharmacy is amazing!!! The customer service is really great and the VP is the best. The employees are down to earth and very helpful. I did not have to wait too long for perscription to be ready. I was really suprised how the VP just handled my issue and made everything right for me. Shots out to Scott!!!!
