What happened! quality degraded drastically! Charred and chewy octopus. Served end tips which were not edible. Brought it to their attention and they said yes the ends are crispy? Asparagus over cooked. Pasta portions since December decreased by 2\/3. Pasta chewy under cooked and clumped into one big piece I couldn't separate. I am so disappointed this place went downhill after opening. I do not blame the waiters or chefs for this management needs to own this.
