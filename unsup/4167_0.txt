we have had accts with verizon for over 10 years and feel like we are just a number for this store.they are only interested in making you upgrade your phone,not fixing the problem.keep paying your bill but they wont fix your phone,upgrade or sorry there is nothing we can do.i would stay away from this store.travis zandt and billy lester have the i could careless attitude and are bad for business
