The concept is gross, the food is sub-par, but if your drunk on the strip in Old Vegas it's fun to go once.  They put a hospital gown on you when you sit down, it's fun.  Then you order a heart clogger burger.  All burgers and fries are cooked in lard.  \n\nSo bad for you, but a decent burger.  It could be much better.  Good looking girls in nursing garb serve you a grease laden burger.  Not the worst idea. \n\nSub-par food, all grease, hot women servers.   2 stars\n\nThanks
