We had a great experience celebrating a birthday at Cafe Monarch. Servers were excellent. All very kind and accommodating, as we were with our four year old. One server even made up a salad plate for her to enjoy instead of just sharing with mommy. Great ambience. Some of the courses were five-star, such as the sea bass, tuna, bucatini, and relleno. The food was good quality, but for the price, we would expect every course to be five stars. Awesome that they also surprised us with cake and a small birthday gift. Thank you Cafe Monarch!
