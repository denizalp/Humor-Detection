This is one of THE BEST Buffets that there is on the LV strip. =) I have to agree..seafood wise, It's WAY better than WYNN's buffet..it has much mroe of a variety of foods to choose from & its cheaper & just much better =)\nGREAT seafood selection & desert too..You really can sneak in b\/w Lunch & dinner & just pay the lunch price..hahahah..LOL =)\nI just LOVE the King Crab legs here! I can eat tons & tons of it! =)
