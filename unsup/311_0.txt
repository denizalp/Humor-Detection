A clean environment with a large assortment of ethnic cuisines and food types to choose from. They had southern food, a carving station, Mexican, Japanese, raw seafood, pasta station, Chinese and a dessert section. One thing that distinguishes this buffet though is the unlimited alcoholic beverages and the cool self serve drinking stations. Bon appetite!
