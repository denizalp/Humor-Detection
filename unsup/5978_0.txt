Gotta admit I was a little let down after being told that the barbers only shave goatees, not glue them on. I even brought my own hair and a sketch and everything for Ryan to sculpt. \n\nThought the complimentary black and white cookies were slightly problematic.\n\nNevertheless now I have a great haircut and a date on skype with a lovely woman named \"InsaneClownPosse420\" so thanks Eddy's! Wish me luck!
