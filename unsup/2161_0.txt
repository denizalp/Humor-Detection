Went for dinner this evening for the firt time.  Beautiful building. Food was not good.  We had a noodle dish and calamari. Our friends had sushi rolls and edemame.  It was so salty you almost couldn't eat it.  Not much flavor other than the salt.  Waiter was nice but never even checked to see if our food was alright.  The music was bizarre! Rap music at a nice sushi restaurant was not very relaxing.  It was like they couldn't decide if they were a nice eatery or a bar and grill.  Won't be back.
