i dunno.. i'm not really one to go and watch men strip.  i pretty much got talked into going.\n\nI HAD THE GREATEST TIME AND LOST MY VOICE THE NEXT DAY! so much screaming and LOTS of hot guys!!\n\nmy favorites were FERNANDO MACIA (who's got a gorgeous brazillian accent that'll make you melt) and NATHAN MINOR. ohhhhhhh my god!!\n\ni've never had my panties sooo wet in my entire life!  NEXT TIME, I WILL GLADLY GO BACK AGAIN!
