The reason that I give this place one star is because, it's not actual \"Gelato\" it doesn't have the nice smooth texture that Gelato is supposed to. They say that they import their ingredients from Italy, but there is no way, it's just plain ol' ice cream that I could go to coldstone for.. The flavors don't have that wow! factor that gelato should. I have definitely had better!
