Homeowner beware. I hired Brad Fischer Painting to paint the inside of my house. He said it would take 3-4 days to complete, it took 7 days plus weekend. Also, he quotes low so he can get the job then when complete he charges double. I would not recommend his services. But if you decide to use him make sure all the details are in the contract.
