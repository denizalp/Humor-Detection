I have been here a couple times now. The staff is very friendly and high spirits. The crowd is also in good spirits and isn't hard to talk to anyone sitting next to you. The cost is very reasonable and it's a byob, for a few dollars more. The Arcade is a non profit. The comedians are there to entertain and make you laugh, which I find they do a pretty good job! They will be moving to a bigger venue come September, so they are apparently doing a great job!
