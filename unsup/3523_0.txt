I went with a guy who is from out of town--he is not a high roller--we had a wonderful time---the lap dances he seemed to enjoy the drinks were cheap and the girl bartender was great  this is good value   really is would tell my friend to go when they are from out of town and want a not so expensive nite on the town marcella
