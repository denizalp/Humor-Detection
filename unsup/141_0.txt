I had high hopes for this place.  Went there with 6 other people today. They managed to mangle the orders for EVERY single person.  Four of us ordered food which NEVER arrived.  The drink orders for half of the group were wrong.  The worst part was that they did not seem to notice or care.  Too bad, because I had planned to make it a regular cafe on my list of places to visit.
