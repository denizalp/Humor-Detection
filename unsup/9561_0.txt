Just recently went to Monta Noodle House and I really enjoyed it. Coming down with a bit of a cold, this was the perfect place to begin the remedies!! Very quaint and cozy place, with very friendly staff. Great place for a cold\/rainy evening, bowl of hot ramen noodles will make it all worth it! The Shoyu was really tasty, but I think next time I may try the Miso, sounded delicious. I'd definitely say a wonderful spot for any season!
