Ok, I'm all done with this procedure.  I'm sure glad I did it even though some say I can be a big baby.  It was painless!  And my implants look great (I got two implants with a bridge).  \nThe staff was terrific and the dentist was fantastic.  I am very happy and I would recommend them to anyone who needs their help.
