I'm so impressed at this tiny oasis tucked in my neighborhood. I was greeted and helped through out the process of finding some new unfamiliar plants I was on the hunt for. The crew even potted one right there in a new pot I also purchased. I had great instructions and an offer to bring any sick plants back for a check up. I will absolutely return. They carry many kinds of peppers, herbs, cacti, indoor and outdoor plants. One note: watch for wasps!
