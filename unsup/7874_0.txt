Such a fun activity to do with friends! Went in a group of 6 to celebrate a friends birthday and was able to bring in our own snacks. We brought donuts! Haha\n\nThe instructor was fun, upbeat and had a couple of good jokes up her sleeve! \n\nAfter three bottles of wine, painting and focusing became a little difficult to do. My painting didn't come out as good as I was hoping but the experience definitely was a good one!
