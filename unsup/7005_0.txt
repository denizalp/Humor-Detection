Freddie's Nutrition is my usual go-to store for protein bars and supplements. Stopped on the way out of LVAC and was disappointed to see their cost on quest bars was way higher than Freddie's. They also don't do discounts on mixed flavors of quest bars. Seemed annoyed when I asked. Will not be back.
