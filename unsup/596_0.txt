Like another reviewer, my mom and I have been going to Heng Hong since the 90s.  Mr. Hong  has altered  everything from my first business suit to cocktail dresses.  He is extremely talented, professional, personable and his prices are very reasonable. He always has a quick turnaround.   And boy is he funny!  When I gained some weight, and needed some alterations, he jokingly said \"oh no honey, the dryer must have just shrunk your pants!\"  Hilarious!  He is a first rate tailor with an amazing personal history, and always has a smile on his face.
