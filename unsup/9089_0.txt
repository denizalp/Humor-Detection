I recently earned my instrument rating after flying with Sierra Charlie Aviation, and I couldn't be happier with the training I received there. My flight instructor Tom, was extremely knowledgeable and very easy to work with. Because of the quality of training I received I was able to earn my rating in the minimum hours required. They also have the nicest C172s out of any flight school in the Phoenix area. I cannot recommend Sierra Charlie Aviation enough to anyone looking into flight training.
